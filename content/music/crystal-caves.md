Crystal Caves is a concept album I have been thinking off for over a year and started to work
on for earnest in late 2018. It is a reflection on my state of mind, as experienced through
therapy. I went through a dark phase in my life in late 2016 that led to a form of burn-out. 

I was lucky to get to meet a wonderful therapist, who helped me work on finding my way back. To her, 
Crystal Caves is dedicated.
