A long walk around Galsklint, the most west part of Fyn, the island in the middle of Denmark. We took
a nice 10km walk around the whole area, saw different water ways, small islands, two castles, worlds end,
swans, sun, rain, ferries, sail-boats, fishermen, and a lot of more or less motivated school children
on their yearly "Motionsdag" just before the fall holidays.

Much needed after a long and tiring week. Back to Switzerland tomorrow.
