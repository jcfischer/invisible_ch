There are several dozen kilometers of hiking ways on our local "house moutain". And sometimes, a
small trail forks off of the main ones. If you take those trails and follow them, adventure
awaits. Tourists laugh, when you tell them that the Uetliberg is dangerous and that people
have had to be rescued by helicopter. 

The trail I took up "Rossweidliegg" and then along the mountain wasn't that dangerous, but 
there were a number of places where things could get quite hairy... As a reward I got 
wonderful views over the lake, the distant alps and the city.
