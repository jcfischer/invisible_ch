This is my **now** page. It is a list of things and projects I'm working on right now (and 
as times go by) a list of things I've done.

Based on the idea of [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com)

## What I'm doing now

Last updated: 2019-01-03

* Working on the Album [Crystal Caves](/2018/11/crystal-caves/). So far I have recorded three
  tracks, at least three more to come
* Working (with my daughter) on providing visuals (a 3D sculpture of programmed LEDs) for a 
  possible live performance of [Crystal Caves](/2018/11/crystal-caves/)
* Getting back into blogging, exploring the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) and working on a
  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) template called [Chaschper](https://github.com/jcfischer/hugo-chaschper)
  that is IndieWeb enabled
* Working on learning to play Jazz guitar, both by being a member of the [ElectricCampfire](https://electriccampfire.com) by [Mike Outram](https://www.mikeoutram.com/) and taking lessons with [Philipp Schauffelberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Schaufelberger)
* Working on performing better with [PlayInTheZone](https://playinthezone.com/) by Mike Morley Fletcher
* Working as a team lead at [SWITCH](https://switch.ch) where I work for a wonderful team of engineers
  that build and operate [SWITCHengines](https://switch.ch/engines), a IaaS cloud for Swiss Academia

  in the next few years
