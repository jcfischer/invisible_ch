This is my **now** page. It is a list of things and projects I'm working on right now (and
as times go by) a list of things I've done.

Based on the idea of [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com)

## What I'm doing now

Last updated: 2026-01-16

### Building with AI

I've gone deep into AI-assisted development. [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) combined with [PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure)](https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI) has become my primary way of building software. In six weeks, I've co-authored ~135,000 lines of TypeScript—tools that help me work, which in turn help Claude help me build more tools. The recursive joy of it is hard to overstate.

Some things I've built:
- [supertag-cli](https://github.com/jcfischer/supertag-cli) - A CLI and MCP server for Tana with semantic search
- Email integration with 10+ years of searchable correspondence
- Daily briefing and meeting preparation systems
- Calendar automation for our apartment in Scuol
- many internal tools

I've written about this journey: [Three Weeks with Claude Code](/posts/2025/12-17-three-weeks-with-claude-code/) and [135,000 Lines of AI-Assisted Code](/posts/2026/01-03-135000-lines-of-ai-assisted-code/).

### Work at SWITCH

Still at [SWITCH](https://switch.ch), wearing two hats: Security Consultant (working with clients and representing the whole breadth of the Switch Securit offering) and Product Owner of [Security Academy](https://switch.ch/security/) (events, workshops, training for the Swiss research and education community).

### Personal Development

Training to become a Gewaltfreie Kommunikation (Nonviolent Communication) Practitioner. Learning to say what I actually mean, hear what others actually need, and navigate the gap between. And being gentle with myself. The imporant part of the NVC is the communication with myself.

### Creative Life

Dancing Argentine Tango for over three years now. Performing with [Narratuos](https://narratuos.ch), our improvisation theater group.

### The Bigger Picture

I'm in what I think of as a "reinventor" phase. Around 60, no role models for this life stage, deliberately exploring what comes next. The overarching goal for 2026: work-life balance. Saying no to good things so I can say yes to the right things.

Living with Daniela in Zürich, escaping to Scuol when we can.
