This website is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Netlify logs access to this website, including
which pages you loaded and your IP address. The data is kept for less than 30 days. 
(See the [Netlify GDPR](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr/) page).


This website also uses a self hosted analytics tracker [Matomo](https://matomo.org)
that does not share data with anybody else than me. The data is anonymized and IP addresses are 
truncated (i.e. the last two octets of an IPv4 address is not stored). You can opt out of 
this tracking by clicking below.
