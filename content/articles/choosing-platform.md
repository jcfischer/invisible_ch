I wanted to bring back from the dead my old website, which was running on an old version
of WordPress. It probably got hacked, as one day I received a text from a friend, asking about
the error message that showed up (instead of the stale content that hadn't been updated for 
years)

I also wanted to move away from WordPress and was looking for alternatives. Via a blog post 
I read (yes, blogs still are a thing, it seems) I found [Ghost](https://ghost.org) which looked 
good. Instead of just diving straight into installing it, I decided to [ask the collective wisdom
of Twitter for suggestions](https://twitter.com/jcfischer/status/1078567149986295808).
