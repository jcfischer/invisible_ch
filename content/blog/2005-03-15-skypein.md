[Skype][1] has started the [SkypeIn Beta][2] (Windows only at the moment). Sign up & set up is skype like easy and it calling my new number worked 30 seconds after paying for it.

At the moment I have a 3 month subscription, paying EUR 10. This is more of a test, than a real number - but who knows - that might change.

You can call me on +1 (415) 367-3772 - I might be online...
