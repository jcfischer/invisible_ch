In between all the work that is heading our way, we found time time to launch our companies website: Head over to [www.invisible.ch](http://www.invisible.ch) and check it out. (German speaking only)

If you are looking to hand out consulting work with Notes/Domino, Unix, Java, Intranets in general, maintenance of infrastructure give us a call - especially if you are in Switzerland...
