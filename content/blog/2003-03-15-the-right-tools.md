I had to drill a couple of holes today to hang a picture and a piece where the kids can hang their clothes. We have solid concrete walls and my old power-drill just didn't cut it. So today I went out and bought a new one: 750W instead of 400W. A second grip in front to hold the drill better. A distance measurment device that prevents deeeeep holes.

It took about 4 seconds to drill each of the four holes.  

Lesson learned: Get the right tool for the job. The price paid is offset more than enough by the joy of actually getting the things done you wanted instead of fighting with a piece of junk. 

Why does it take so much to act on that realisation? It's not something that is new to me.
