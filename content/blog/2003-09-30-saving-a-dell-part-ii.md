After all in all one hour on the phone yesterday with Dell support, flashing of the BIOS, unplugging and plugging the LCD cable and other chant and incantations, today a technician arrived with a brand new LCD panel and switched it for the old one. After switching on the laptop - the same display problems persist....

So it's not the panel, but the graphicscard that is faulty.

I'll get a new one tomorrow morning - sigh...
