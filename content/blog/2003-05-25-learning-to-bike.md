My son is almost six years old and one of the last kids on the block to bike. Even the three year old kids could do it. 

We didn't understan why ... Then my wife had the idea to go to a "real" cycle shop. We came out with a new (and expensive) bike. That was yesterday. This morning we went out to try it.

It took him 15 minutes before he drove on his own, another 5 min to learn how to get off without falling, and 10 to start on his own. 

Lesson learnt: Don't try to save on getting the right stuff, it's not worth it.
