When I did my Masters in Science, I had to take a number of modules on topics that were wasted time ("Web Programming in XHTML and PHP" being my absolute favorite time and energy wasting exercise), but one module where I learned heaps and heaps was "Security Engineering".

The course itself was so so (as - unfortunately most of the modules and courses that the University of Liverpool gave), but the book we were required to read was one of the best technical books I ever had the joy to read: [Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems (Amazon.de)](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0470068523/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=0470068523&linkCode=as2&tag=invisiblech-21) [Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems (Amazon.com)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470068523/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470068523&linkCode=as2&tag=invisiblech-20)Â It is a extremely accessible book, with load and loads of information presented in easy to read format, but with enough depth (and a fantastic list of sources)

Ross Anderson has a blog "[Light Blue Touchpaper](http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/)" where he announced, that [the 2nd edition of his book is now free to download](http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2013/02/04/security-engineering-now-available-free-online/). Highly highly recommended reading for everyone with just a passing interest in security!
