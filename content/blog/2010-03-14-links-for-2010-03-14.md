[Caught in a Web Â» HTC Hero USB Tether on Mac OS X](http://www.dinke.net/blog/en/2009/11/10/htc-hero-usb-tether-on-mac-os-x/)


                

something that "just works" with the iPhone takes around 4 hours to get working with a Android phone... This instructions + liberal installation of Tunnelblick and Viscosity finally got the HTC Hero to work as a modem for the Mac.

My guess is that the Viscosity tap/tun drivers made the difference - but I'm not sure... Anyway - lot's of dinking around - let's see how long this setup keeps working :(
