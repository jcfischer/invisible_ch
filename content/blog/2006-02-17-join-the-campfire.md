[37signals][1], the company behind [Basecamp][2] and Ruby On Rails have launched their next application: [Campfire][3]. Campfire is a chat application, that shares some traits with [Internet Relay Chat][4] but runs inside a web browser. There are some added benefits like searchable transcripts, file sharing. Plus, it looks really nice:

I'm running on the 30 days trial account to see, if it solves enough problems that it's worth to shell out $12 per month for a regular account. 

As an experiment, I have setup a [public InVisible Chat Room][5] where you can find me, when I'm online.
