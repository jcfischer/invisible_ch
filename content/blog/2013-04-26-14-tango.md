Daniela and I have been taking [Argentinian Tango lessons](https://www.elsocial.ch/) for the past two months. We are soon (like this sunday) finished with the introduction course and planning on taking the next step. Part preparation, part training, part fun saw us go to a [Milonga with live music](https://www.elsocial.ch/Pages/Tango_tanzabende.html) tonight. The mix of people was fascinating - young women and men, middle aged couples and a couple of seniors. There was dancing, listening to music and enjoying the spectacular dancers. We managed to not bump into any other couples, staying in the groove (mostly) and very quickly exhausting our repertoire of figures.

We had a lot of fun and will be going again. Now that our kids have grown up so much, it is a relief to be able to live as a couple again and go out. Tonight was the second night in a row of three were we are doing something just for ourselves. I'm glad our marriage survived the last 15 or so years, when life was mostly about logistics (everything from changing diapers, to being at home to accomodate the crazy, family unfriendly kindergarden and school times, helping the kids get through school and so on and on). Our teenagers are quite capable of [doing things on their own](/2013/03/09/60-life-game-video/) by now - and that gives us the much needed time to learn to become a couple again.
