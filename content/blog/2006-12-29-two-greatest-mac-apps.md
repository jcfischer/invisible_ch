I'm hopelessly behind my RSS reading. I'm trying to catch up, reading really fast, skimming and unsubscribing from a lot of feeds. 

Merlin Mann's [43Folders][1] however, is going to stay a little longer - in part because he brought my attention to two really great applications for the mac:

* [Backdrop][2] and 
* [Menushade][3]

[Backdrop][2] just puts up a big window (in any colour you like - I take black, thank you) that you can use to block out all the other windows and the mess on your desktop. [Menushade][3] dims the Mac menubar (or makes it completely black). It springs back to life, when you mouse into it...

So writing a blog entry looks like this:

instead of this:

I like it!
