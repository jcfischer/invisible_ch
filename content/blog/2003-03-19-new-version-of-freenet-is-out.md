A long time in the coming: [Freenet](http://freenetproject.org), the secure and anonymous P2P plattform, is out in a new version.

New features include:
- FEC - Forward Error Correction: Large files are split into many small pieces that contain information that allows freenet to reconstruct pieces that have gone missing.
- Support for dynamic IP adresses
- more

Get it, install it, make freenet grow!
