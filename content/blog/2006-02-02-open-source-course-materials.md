One of the things I've been thinking about ever since announcing the [Ruby On Rails Training in Zurich][1] is if I should "Open source" the course materials (maybe even making the development process open, so everybody could see where I am, what I'm doing)

Today I attended a talk by [Cory Doctorow][2] who talked on "Digital Restriction Management (DRM)". One of the analogies to protected content he gave was as follows (paraphrased)

> One of the early sciences was alchemy. Alchemists kept their results secret. Consequently, everyone 
> of them had to make the experience that drinking mercury is a bad idea. Also the science stagnated. One day
> one decided to publish his results and the the field took off. The 500 years before that even are called the *dark ages*,
> the hundred years following are called *enlightenment*

Would the same hold true for sharing course materials? Would someone steal it? What are the things speaking for this idea, what is against it? What are your thoughts?
