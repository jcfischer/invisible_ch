Incredible to not only see, but to work with [Frank Doran Shihan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Doran_(aikido)), who is in Zurich the 25th time. It's enlightening seeing a man that is 80 years old have so much energy and presence on the mat, with humour and joy.





I have been to his seminars for 3 or 4 years now, and they are incredibly inspiring. Hopefully we will have the chance to have him as our guest for many more years to come.
