The [Martian NetDrive](http://www.martian.com/) is exactly the kind of gear I need - both at home and in the office.

It's a small fanless Linux box with a 120GB disk and both wireless and wired LAN capabilities. It acts as a SMB fileserver and the claim is that you unpack it and then plug it in. Sounds like a plan.

And because it's Linux based it should be easy (according to the a [How to turn a Martian NetDrive into another OpenAFS file server](http://www.thok.org/intranet/toys/martian-openafs-notes.html) document) to hack it. I want two of those machines to rsync their contents over the internet. Perfect distributed backup!
