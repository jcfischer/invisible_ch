I've been an on and off [Opera](http://www.opera.com) user back in the Opera 4, 5 and 6 days. Ever since Opera 7 came out however, Opera is the single browser I use.  Today Opera 7.11 is released. I cam across this
[30 Days to becoming an Opera Lover (TnTLuoma.com)](http://tntluoma.com/opera/lover/6/) 30-days guide to Opera (the 6 version) and learnt a few tricks along the way. 

If you aren't an Opera user yet, go over and read it, and then convert.

If you are using Opera - go there and learn something new
