It's been quite a while since I have been doing long presentations, actually trying to teach things to people, but nonetheless, [Conference Presentation Judo](http://perl.plover.com/yak/presentation/) was a good read, and got quite some head nodding from me... "Yeah - I remember making that mistake"

If you give presentation, take a look, and you might learn a trick or two. Be sure to read the detailed notes...
