Ray Ozzie, now CTO of Microsoft, then founder of Iris and Groove, has been doing some interesting work on the way, the web enables inter-app communication. His latest endeavour is [Live Clipboard][1] a way to bridge communication between web apps or web apps and desktop apps. There are a number of demo [screencasts][2] that show how this works. 

As usual (?), Ray is licensing this under a [Creative commons][3] license so we all can share the fun.

It's interesting to see, how Ray is applying his deep understanding of collaboration to seemingly simple tasks and comes up with small and beautiful solutions. Things are looking good for Microsoft, if he can apply this sort of thinking to the Office products.
