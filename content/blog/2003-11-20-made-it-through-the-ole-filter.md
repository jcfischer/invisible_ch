[Ole](http://w-uh.com/) had this to say...


<blockquote>In a few cases, the blog was still there, the blogger was still active, but I didn't see anything interesting.  And if I don't find it interesting, I'm not going to link it.  Your mileage may vary!</blockquote>



And - I'm still on his extended blog-roll... Feels good, somehow ;-)
