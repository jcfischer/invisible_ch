Last week I dropped my [P800](/archives/000046.html) 3 meters onto a concrete floor. The screen broke so I sent it in for repairs. Today I got a call that the repair is going to cost over CHF300 - a new P800 can be had for about CHF 900. 

While I like the P800, it has enough warts that I'm considering an alternative. Right now I have re-lived my Handspring Visor and my old R520. I really, really, really liked that I had all my adresses on the phone and being able to call any number without further syncing. 

So I'm in a state of dilemma now: 

  * bite the bullet, repair the P800 and stay with it - not caring about the warts it has
  * Bite the bullet, repair the P800 and then sell it on ebay and get:
    * A [Treo600](https://www.handspring.com/treo600/index.jhtml) (meaning that I have to change my contract to a new provider (which is going to cost me quite a sum) and I don't have Bluetooth
    * Buy a [Palm T3](https://vowe.net/archives/003612.html) which seems to be just around the corner, and a cheap mobile phone (T68i)
  * Something entirely different?

What would you recommend?
