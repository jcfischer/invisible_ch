Mixing ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 characters on a webpage, encoding Umlauts 16-byte ISO representation and declaring them to be UTF-8 - no wonder, some pages with Umlauts look like shit, or make the rendering application throw exception (complaining about malformed UTF-8).

Such is the joy of i18n development. And a joy, if the people doing the development have no real clue of what they are doing in the first place.

So - with a swing of the clue-stick: Here's a [Unicode Table][1] that contains the UTF-8 table, the ASCII, the HEX and a descriptive text.
