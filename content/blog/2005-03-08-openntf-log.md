Of course I know about the [openNTF][1] website that collects open source Notes applications. Also I read about the [OpenLog][2] template, but I haven't used it - until 2 weeks ago when I needed some information why my agents were failing suddenly after a Domino 5 to Domino 6 migration. I remembered about the OpenLog database and decided to give it a try.

What can I say: I'm a fool that I haven't used this much sooner. The installation and implementation into my applications was a snap and within minutes I had the exact error message and place of where the code failed. Fixing it was pretty easy. In the last weeks I have OpenLog enabled all the Notes applications I currently support and I expect that this will make my life much easier in the future.

If you haven't done so, check it out immediately. Highly Recommended
