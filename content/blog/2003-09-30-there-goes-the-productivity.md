Uh - oh... so much for my productive streak today...

The [Lock On: Modern Air Combat](http://www.lo-mac.com) demo is [out](http://www.3dgamers.com/news/more/1064687945/)...

See you later

Oh and download of the 123 MB file was done in just about 30 minutes - thanks to my [1024/256 ADSL](/archives/000189.html) and [BitTorrent](http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/)
