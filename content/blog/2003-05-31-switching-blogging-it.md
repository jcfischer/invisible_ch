I'm working on a Dell Inspiron 8200 with Windows XP. When I bought it a couple of months ago, I alos put a copy of [RedHat Linux 7.3](http://www.redhat.com) on it, but didn't use it much. Prompted by [vowe](http://vowe.net/archives/003368.html) about his installing RH 9, I decided to try that too. 3 Diskimages and an hour of installation later I had an updated system that hung forever on starting sendmail and canna (whatever that is). It displayed in 800x600 during install and not at all after I booted from HD.

Time to download [Knoppix](http://www.knoppix.org) and try that. 
Amazing: It found my wireless LAN, my USB Diskkey, the PC-Card with the CF from my digital camera, booted into 1600x1200 (with just a little help on the initial commandline - fb=1600x1200 ), has sound, and I'm blogging with Mozilla now.

In the background a script is busy, installing Knoppix to the harddisk. The next entry in this blog should be from a HD based install of this distribution... So far 76% copied, next step is to install LILO instead of GRUB. I'll keep you posted ;-)
