I use [Bloglines][1] to read my daily dose of RSS. My work is spread around multiple places with multiple computers, and the thought of synchronizing 140+ feeds (what have I read, what haven't I read) over those computers just doesn't jive with me. And I'm not even sure, it this would work at all.

Anyway: Bloglines has a nice feature, that tells you, how many people have subscribed to a particular feed. Of course, the ego-maniac in me has subscribed to my own feed (the Atom feed of course, me also being modern). There are 4 subscribers to that. Coupled with a lot of people coming here to search for [ASCII porn][2] (my number 1 Google search term), I thought that I had a relative small audience. Then today, I subscribed to my RSS2 feed also -- and behold -- there are 46 subscribers to that one. My regular readership just 10 folded, my ego got boosted to new heights.

I'd like to extend a warm welcome to all of you readers. Thanks for being here!
