You know that you should get some more sleep if you

 * instead of working on the train during the commute, you read the last 60 mails on the RubyOnRails mailinglist
 * you fall asleep doing so, and give up with the computer, closing
 * more or less sleep for 40 minutes during the train ride
 * wake up to the announcment of arriving at the destination train station
 * falling asleep again, just 1 minute before arriving
 * waking up while the new passengers arrive and take their seats

But then, I was awake very quick and got out of the train in record time...
