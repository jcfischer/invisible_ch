My next public speaking - or rather workshopping - event will be on 13.9.2007. [CH-Open][1] is holding their annual [workshop days][2] and I'll be holding [Workshop number 13][3] with the title:

Ruby on Rails - Hype, "Business as usual" oder "The next big thing"?

It's going to be a one day workshop and my plan is to have the participants walk through the building of a complete (simple) web app, touching different issues  (ease of development, test driven, scalability, enterprise ready) and giving them a feel for how Rails is handling those issues.
