Time passes. You wait.

More time passes. 

It might seem to you, dear reader, that nothing really happened the last few weeks. The truth - of course - is different. 

Just the most important things:

* Henriette and Thomas got married - check out the [flickr pics][1]
* I presented at [rails-konferenz.de][2] - Patrick Lenz made [wonderful pictures][3]
* The web site for my book has gone live: [rails-praxis.de][4]
* I coerced my publisher to actually release more than the introduction of the book as PDF: I give you the chapter on [RSpec and Userstories][5]
* I am now [part][7] of the [headshift family][6]
* My company is looking at expanding: We are looking for larger offices, and interesting people - [apply within][8]
* Lot of exiting work signed up
* My grandmother died at the age of 89 - funeral tomorrow - just before:
* [reboot][9]
