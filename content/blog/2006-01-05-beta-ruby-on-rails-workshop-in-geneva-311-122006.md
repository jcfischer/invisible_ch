title: Beta Ruby On Rails workshop in Geneva, 31.1 - 1.2.2006

Keeping the tradition of [getting real][1] and the beta books by the [Pragmatic Programmers][2], I have decided to host a beta version of my upcoming [Ruby On Rails Training in Zurich][3] workshop. The plan is to host a beta version of the training on 31.1 and 1.2.2006 in Geneva, just before the [Lift06][4] conference.

Here's the deal:

I'll be hosting a "beta-workshop" of the upcoming Ruby On Rails seminar. In two days, participants will learn how to develop web-application in Ruby On Rails (bring your own Laptop) and work in an agile fashion with elements of Extreme Programming. The beta workshop won't be quite finished in terms of structure and presentation, and will have beta documentation. All the major pieces of things to learn will be in place though, and the schedule will be roughly the same as the finished  workshop/training taking place 27.-28.2.2006 in Zurich. Language is english.

Instead of the regular price of CHF 750 for the 2-days workshop, the beta workshop will cost CHF 350. Lift06 participants get an additional CHF 100 discount.

The workshop is intended for web-developers that have experience with database-driven websites with knowledge of a programming language and object-oriented skills. Ruby knowledge is not necessary.

If there are more than 8 people participating, I will hold this workshop. If you are interested, send an email to "info@invisible.ch". The first email carries no obligation yet but is there to gauge interest. Only if there is enough interest, a second round of final confirmations will be made. To signal your interest, please send email by friday, 13.1.2006. The final confirmations will have to be made latest 18.1.2006.
