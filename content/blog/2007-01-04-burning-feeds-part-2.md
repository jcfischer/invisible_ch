I did use [Feedburner][1] a long, long time ago - and switched it off again.

Not being happy that I haven't done any significant changes to my blog in a long time, I decided to move my RSS feeds back to Feedburner again. This has happened, and you should be getting the new feed automatically. The only exception are those two people that use a URL like this

    /?feed=atom

to retrieve my feeds. I haven't been able to coerce mod_rewrite to handle that nut-case yet.

Any ideas on how to handle that?
