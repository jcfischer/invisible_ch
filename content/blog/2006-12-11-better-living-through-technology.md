I have been having this idea for quite a while: I have lot's of technology in my house and in the office. Starting with 3 Macs (including the [iMac](https://tracker.tradedoubler.com/click?p=21664&a=1319235&url=https://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/swissdestore?&family=iMac) for my wife, that we got this weekend), a decent Home Theater with HD Beamer, lot's of cell phones, and the robot cleaner. I use dozens of web sites to coordinate, share and keep track of things. I use a lot of software.

All of this makes my life better. Well - most of it in any case. There are a number of ideas brewing, to write (or bitch) about these things.
