[Bitflux](http://www.bitflux.ch/) has compiled the [Top100 list of swiss blogs](http://php5.bitflux.org/top100/). This humble blogs comes in at rank 99 (only a couple of ranks behind my blogging friend [tanja](http://www.nja.ch/)) Interestingly, the [Muga-Blog](http://www.muenstergass.ch/blog/), one of the top business blogs in Switzerland doesn't make the list. Is the Technorati ranking reliable? And when will our [invisible business blog](http://not.invisible.ch) make the ranks?
