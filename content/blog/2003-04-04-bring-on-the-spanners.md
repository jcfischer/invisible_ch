Via [vowe](http://vowe.net): [Mesopotamia. Babylon. The Tigris and Euphrates](http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,927849,00.html) by [Arundhati Roy](http://www.google.com/search?q=Arundhati+Roy&sourceid=opera&num=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) is a strong text that sums up a lot of the problems we, the people, have with this war.

A must read!

(and while you're at it, read [The algebra of infinite justice posted on 29. September 2001)
