I know and write in way to many languages. Specifically in computer languages. Over the years I have written code in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, LotusScript, LotusFormulas, Smalltalk, Perl, Python, Ruby, Pascal, Modula-2, APL (read only, thanks god), 8051 Assembler and probably a couple of things I have hidden from my conciousness. I love languages.

But I hate writing them. I'm constantly switching between languages (at the moment: LotusScript, JavaScript, Java and Perl) and I always get the small things wrong:

  * End of Line ; or not
  * String manipulation
  * bit aritmetic
  * a thousand other small thing


Here's help: [Syntax across languages](https://merd.net/pixel/language-study/syntax-across-languages/). Thanks!
