[Trepia](http://www.trepia.com) is an instant messenger with a twist: It supposedly knows where you are and populates itself with people from your neighbourhood.

Hmm - I have people nearby from Dover, Massachuset (?), Dresden, The Nederlands - interesting... All in all: 28 people in my area... Wow - a big area!
