The book "Getting Things Done" by David Allen is one of my all time favorites. David has helped my productivity enormously with his workflow process and most of all the idea, that you need to get all of the things you need to do out of your head and on paper so they will stop nagging you.

Now he has written a new book, "Ready for Anything: 52 Productivity Principles for Work ans Life". It's a collection of thoughts that he has been sharing on the mailing list of his [DavidCo web site](http://www.davidco.com), organized and rewritten. The very first chapter, "Cleaning up creates new directions" had me scrambling to do a full brain dump of all the things and projects that I need to be working on. Getting them out on paper (or in my case into [LifeBalance](http://www.llamagraphics.com/LB/LifeBalanceTop.html) has helped me on getting a few things done right away and a much better understanding of what I need to do during the next days and weeks - and boy - there is a lot of things that need to be done.
