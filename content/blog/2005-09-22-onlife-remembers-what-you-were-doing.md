This is too cool:



[Onlife](https://www.ethomaz.com/onlife/) looks at what you do in several programs (Safari / Firefox, Mail, iChat, iTunes) and stores all kinds of information about the interaction. You can then tag it (or leave it) and search for it.



For example, I'm installing PostgreSQL on my Mac and I found [some info](https://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/postgres.html) on the Apple Developer Connection website about this. If I need this page again, later, I can search for "Postgres" and "I looked at it longer than 2 minutes" and "Safari"



Here's how that will look:

Nice - and hopefully there will be more programs watched!



I have been longing for such an application almost eternally - this is a dream come true! (and has traces of the [Remembrance Agent](https://www.remem.org/) or Nat's [Dashboard](https://www.nat.org/dashboard/) which to my knowing never made it into a finished application)
