Today has been a web design day...

Here are some of the tools that have helped me (or would have helped, had I found them earlier):



  * [The Bookmarklet DOM inspector](https://slayeroffice.com/?c=/content/tools/modi.html) -- absolutely fantastic. This saves me from starting Mozilla to use the DOM inspector
  * [The DOM tree chart](https://slayeroffice.com/?c=/content/tools/dom_chart.html) -- also from the [SlayerOffice](https://slayeroffice.com)
  * [The Listamatic](https://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/) -- convert regular lists to nice menus
