For a small project coming up, the [Twisted Framework](http://www.twistedmatrix.com/products/twisted) in Python seems like an intersting foundation. 
Twisted handles all kinds of network stuff for you and allows you to write the top level stuff without having to worry about the gory details of the network. 
An [Fake SMTP server](http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2003-June/004624.html) only takes 136 lines of Python code (and that includes extensive docstrings)
