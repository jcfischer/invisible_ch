* [Emacs Versors][1] - Context sensitive cursor movement. Can we have that in TextMate plase?
 * [Searchable Ruby and Rails documentation][2] - Good stuff
 * [Boompa Launch Post Mortem][3] - 2 guys, 2 months, 1 Web 2.0 startup
 * [Pyro][4] - a Mac App that wraps [Campfire][5] - simple is beautiful (be sure to check the [InVisible Campfire][6])
 * [rcov][7] - ruby coverage - helps you write tests - I will have more to say about that soon
