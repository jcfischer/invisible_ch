This blog hasn't seen much activity the last couple of weeks, due to not only a lot of work, but more back pain. It seems - so the doctor diagnosed - that I have developed [Diskushernie][1]. I have massive pains in my left leg (the Ischias nerve) and have to go to therapy 2-3 times a week.

Combined with the hot weather and the soccer world cup, there's not much time for blogging...
