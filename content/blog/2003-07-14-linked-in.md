I recently wrote about the [LinkedIn Locked Out](https://www.invisible.ch/archives/000089.html) problem I was having. Well - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) changed a subtle thing: You can opt in to receive requests directly from people that are more than 4 degrees away from you. I wondered how I came to suddenly have 60+ people in my network that I didn't know about. Then it dawned on me, that these 60 people must be the first ones to opt in for the direct contect feature. I opted in too - and the very next morning I had a mail from a Swiss/American guy who was busy patching up the disparate networks. He knew either [Joi](https://joi.ito.com) or Reid himself - so when he invited me to his network, BAM, I suddenly was connected to 1500+ people. This morning, I'm up to 2200+ connections - and boy, some of them look interesting.
I haven't made my own request yet, but this afternoon, I'm meeting Tom, who invited me to his network for some business talk...
Good stuff, LinkedIn ;-)
