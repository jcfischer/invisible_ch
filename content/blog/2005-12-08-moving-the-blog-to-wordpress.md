title: Moving the blog to Wordpress?
type: post
wordpress_id: 487

Even though you haven't seen me post on this blog recently, I have been busy deleting comment spam all the time. My [MoveableType](http://www.sixapart.com/) installation is pretty old, and the SpamFiltering solution is quite old too. Everything runs on a creaky server out of my office. Also I'm not to fond of fiddling with the layout of the blog (although web visitors might have noticed some changes) because it means I have to republish the complete site.



So I have been thinking about moving to a new blog system. While I have some experience with [TextPattern](http://www.textpattern.com/) and [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/), I would like to try out [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) too.



My main interest is to keep the permalinks to the 450+ articles I have written in the past and secondly to make my life administering this blog easier. Also I want to drop categories and move towards a tag-based organization of my content. I haven't yet looked at Wordpress in detail to see if I can keep the permalinks, but this is something that went onto my todo-list as of 30 seconds ago. Anyone out there know the answer?
