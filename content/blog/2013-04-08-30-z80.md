Thanks to [Lutz Korte ](http://twitter.com/lutz)I have a [ADA MP-1](http://en.audiofanzine.com/guitar-preamp/ada/MP-1/user_reviews/) MIDI controlled Tube guitar pre amp on loan (to see if I like it). Unfortunately, the power chord is a fix installed german one, and I didn't have the necessary connectors or tools handy to change it. But I opened it up and saw this wonderful electronics board (Pic will be replaced with an own picture as soon as I have better light)

Besides the Tubes (!) there is a lot of discrete electronics and a Z80 microprocessor (the big chip halfway on the right, halfway hidden behind the ribbon cable). Fond memories of Sinclair computers, birthday gift of "[Programming the Z80](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_the_Z80)" by Rodnay Zaks (my parents probably I was crazy when I wanted that book for my 15th or 16th birthday)

Really looking forward to powering this archeological gem up to hear how it sounds!
