UPDATE: I have disabled comments for this post, because I'm getting spammed with hundreds of messages on exactly this post. Feel free to comment somewhere else :-)

Ruby (and Ruby on Rails) are slowly picking up steam in Zurich (and Switzerland) so it seems to be a good time to start a Ruby user group. Anyone that want's to start this with me is invited on **Thursday, 28.9.2006** in the evening to meet, eat, drink and chat about Ruby (and Rails). 

We'll see how many people are interested, and if there is interest in a formal group or in a (ir)regular meeting. If there are more than two people coming, I'll organise space in a restaurant.

If there's anyone interested in presenting something, let me know.

Please comment here if you are interested, send me an email at  or find another way to get in touch with me.

**Update:** There's a lot of interest, we are up to 7 people now, and there's a [SwissRUG mailing list][1] to further coordinate. The meeting  will take place, details to be announced.
