A while ago, I was listed on the [Swiss Weblogs](http://swissblogs.com/?details=58) Wiki and had a chance to update my profile. Stephanie who runs the list, mailed me and asked me to provide some keywords to go with my entry. I couldn't think of any, so I let the matter rest. After a couple of weeks, she caught up with me on IRC at #joiito and insisted ;-) on me providing keywords. So I did - and I'm unhappy with the result.

I'm no fan of keywords - they usually are wrong. Same thing with the [Taxonomy Madness](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/25/TaxonomyMadness) (and I confess, I have a bit of it too here - see the categories). I have the constant feeling, that whatever I put in as a keyword or a category is ultimately wrong.



  * Wrong, because it's plain wrong choosen
  * Wrong, because the keyword or category only captures part of the content
  * Wrong, because **I** chose the keyword, and someone else (like **you out there** would have chosen something completely different)
  * Wrong, because the item belongs to more than one keyword (and no, it doesn't help to include two keywords)
  * Wrong, because my conceptual framework changes over time and what seems right today, is totally off tomorrow
  * Wrong, because it's so [arbitrary](http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/) like a certain [classification of animals](http://www.multicians.org/thvv/borges-animals.html?1) (and yes, I do realize, that [Mark](http://diveintomark.org) knows this too)


Give me a tool, that get's rid of classifications, but gives me access to everything I need to know and I'll be happy man.
