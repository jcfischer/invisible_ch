Simon Willson does it again: (or rather he links to the right stuff): The [CSS Bookmarklets](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/06/03/bookmarkletsAndCSS) let you for example edit CSS and see the changes while you edit the stylesheet. Or they show you the ancestors hierarchy of the styles. Way cool and this will help me in my development efforts!
