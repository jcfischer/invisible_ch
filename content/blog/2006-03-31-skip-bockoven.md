I met Skip when he worked at [Action Technologies][2] as a sales man. When we worked on the "Ibex Domain Manager", we hired him and brought him and his wife Cindy to Switzerland for a couple of months. He became a friend and we were sad, that we couldn't get enough traction in the company, that we could keep him. So he went back to the US, and we only talked to each other on a very irregular schedule.

A couple of years ago, I heard that he had cancer. But he still sent out life-signs from time to time, and things sounded good (as far as having cancer sounds good)

Skip [died last friday][1]. His blood cancer caught up with him after seven years. I'll miss you, even though we weren't terrible close to each other.
