After talking to quite a few people about my idea of [open sourcing the course materials for my Rails course][1] I decided to go ahead and just do it. The advantages outweigh the drawbacks as far as I can see them:

*Advantages*

* Giving something back to the community -> Good karma
* Having other people look over the documents could lead to ideas for improvement (what Scoble has had happen to his "Naked Conversations" book)
* Having other people actually see that I'm doing something (Cory Doctorow commented that he was more worried about obscurity, than about people downloading his books)
* Showing potential customers about what they can expect from the course

*Drawbacks*

* Someone might use my materials fro their own course without attribution / proper licensing

I think the advantages far outweigh the drawbacks, so now I'm working on making this happen. I have to decide on a license and how best to share my work.
