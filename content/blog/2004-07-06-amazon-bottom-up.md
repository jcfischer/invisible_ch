What happens if you sort Amazon reviews bottom up? You get [classics](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/07/01/amazonco.shtml).


<blockquote>"I found Mr. Davis' playing to be laughable at best. Finally, it's irritating; and confusing that so many people laud it."  
"It's full of bland harmonizing by guys that could barely swim."  
I must admit I was misled from the beginning, I thought that this book was actually "The Guide to the Galaxy." However, I was disappointed to find that Adams's book is only referring to a made up book that explains useless knowledge to ficticious characters. Therefore making this book even more useless!  
and many, many more</blockquote>
