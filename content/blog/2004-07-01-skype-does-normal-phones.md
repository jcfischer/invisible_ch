I have been using [Skype](http://www.skype.com) for [a while](/archives/000175.html) now and been very satisfied. Recently, Skype has expanded to include calls to POTS (Plain Old Telephone Systems).

You have to buy credits (minimum â‚¬10) and then can call. Interesting rates! Calling Germany from Switzerland is about 50% cheaper than using my discount telephone carrier. Voice quality is excellent.

And P2PVOIP continues to be free. Sounds good to me!
