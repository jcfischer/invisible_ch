Sitting in the breakfast lounge at reboot, I made two interesting observations:




  * The ration between PC and MAC's is roughly 1:1 (and I was thinking that the ration would be like 1:2)


  * The Apple power adapter takes a normal 2-prong small 220V power cable (and no, danish 2 hole wall-outlets don't like the swiss 3-prong power-plug)
