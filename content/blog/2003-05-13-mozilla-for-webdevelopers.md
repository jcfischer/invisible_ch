While I use [Opera](http://www.opera.com) as my day to day browser, for webdevelopment there's no way around [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org).

Gemal has an [article about development with Mozilla](http://www.gemal.dk/mozilla/mozdev.html) and talks about the DOM inspector, the HTTP Liveheader viewer (which I needed this very moment to debug an interaction between a browser, an authentication server and a PeopleSoft application server) in order to script a transaction with [curl](http://curl.haxx.se).
