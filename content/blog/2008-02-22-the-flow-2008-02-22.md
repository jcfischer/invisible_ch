Free Memory
-----------

I have too many applications open all the time, and only 2 GB of memory. The memory management of OSX just doesn't seem to be able to handle this, without regular reboots. [iFreeMem][1] seems to be the solution. Downloaded trial today, let's see, how good it it. 

Current status:

    Arwen:files jcf$ uptime
    8:26  up 4 days, 23:59, 8 users, load averages: 0,41 0,70 0,76


Twittery iPhone
---------------

Have your iPhone twitter its current location every now and then, in case it's stolen (or you want to track someone?). [iPhone LoJack][2] does this for you.


No Password required
--------------------

In corporate settings, single sign on is often done with Smartcards and client certificates. You can have the same with OpenID and client certificates. [Dr Nic explains how][3]. Safari (or rather the Keychain [implementation is horribly broken][4]... and I couldn't get the set identity dialog to appeear)
