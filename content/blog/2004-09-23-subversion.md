I have installed [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org) on my main development server and it was much easier than anticipated.

[This document](http://www.linux-fuer-alle.de/doc_show.php?docid=230) (german) helped me getting it to work within a couple of minutes. Recommended.

Now I need to convert my CVS repositories over to SVN....
