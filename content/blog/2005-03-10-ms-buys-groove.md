Microsoft has aquired [Groove Networks][1]. There are some more [details on the website][2]. 

Does this mean that [Ray Ozzie][3] has more time to [blog][4]?

And does that mean, that Groove has been lost for the Mac community forever?

I have been using Groove right from the start, before the 1.0 version (and [wrote about it][6] on the Heise Newsticker back then). We used it extensively when we were building [Ivorix][5]. I think it was way ahead of it's time then. Unfortunately, the 2.0 release was slow & bloated. I have been using less and less of it over the years - also due to the fact, that basic features like search and printing were missing. So it has disappeared from my Toolset - unlike the other brainchild of Ray, Lotus Notes.

All the best, Ray - I hope you can do what you do best at Microsoft - develop revolutionary ways of working.
