![](http://planet.openid.net/images/logo.jpg)One of the decisions we made for a new project, was to use [OpenID][1] based authentication, instead of the normal username/password. This has led to interesting discussions - mainly about usability. <strike>Most</strike>No people that have tried our new application, had an OpenID identity and so had to log on to one of the OpenID servers, get an Identity, get back to our site and login. Confusing, confusing. And a constant source of comments about getting rid of OpenID. 

But now it seems, that the momentum for OpenID is picking up. The [O'Reilly Radar reports that Microsoft is getting on the OpenID wagon][2]. This is excellent news, I think!
