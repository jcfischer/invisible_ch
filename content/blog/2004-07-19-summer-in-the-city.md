Now that summer finally has arrived, there are some tough decisions to be made before you take a walk in the city:

Either you don your personal music bubble (iPod + Koss PortaPro) and then miss the duo (she plays saxophone, he the chapman stick) playing music by Michael Brecker.

Or you don't. 

And then you have to dodge the people from Amnesty International, Pro Natura and Tele 2 (in order of annoyance)

Today I heard live music and dodged sales people. It was well worth it ;-)
