Tweakfest takes places in "Museum fur Gestaltung" in Zurich. Interestingly enough, at a conference that is about "visions of the digital lifestyle", there is neither electricity for the audience, nor wireless LAN.  So there won't be a backchannel, collaborative note-taking, heckling, background checking of the speakers or all the other fun stuff that would be possible.



Could it be, that "reality of modern conferences" haven't arrived in Zurich yet?



**Update: **Just before I left, there was a WLAN available. Unfortunately, it seemed that it did not allow connections to the internet. Maybe tomorrow will be better
