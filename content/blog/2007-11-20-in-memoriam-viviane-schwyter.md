**meta note:** I sure hope this isn't turning into a regular feature

I got the news from a friend this morning. Viviane, my girlfriend before I met and married my wife, decided to end her life yesterday. We spent a bit more than a year together, including a wonderful 4 week vacation in the US and Hawaii (including a very memorable hike to [Hipuapua Falls][1] with no guide, the sunset in Grand Canyon, Mr. Gottschalks Restaurant in Flagstaff, Vegas, Monument Valley) and many weekends in her families house in [Brissago][2].

We lost contact after I got married, and unfortunately Viviane didn't come to our mutual friends party a couple of weeks ago.
