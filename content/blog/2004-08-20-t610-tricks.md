I have a [Sony Ericsson T610](http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=ch&lc=de&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10055&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10055) and happened upon these [nifty tricks](http://www.esato.com/board/viewtopic.php?topic=38811) that increase the fun factor.

The T610 is a nice little phone, with a bad camera but otherwise it's full featured. As usual with SE phones, it's bluetooth implementation just works and it does all the stuff the mobile professional with too much money (GRPS on holidays to work and surf) needs.

At first, when ompared to soemthing like the [Sharp GX20](http://www.sharp-mobile.com/europe/uk/products/model.asp?id=gx20) which I have been seeing a lot lately, the GX20 (or it's successor the GX30) win hand down. (The screen on the GX models is absolutely stunning (240*320 pixels)). But Bluetooth is only enabled for handsets. There is no modem that can be used (even though the GX20/30 uses GPRS for it's WAP / Web stuff). In short: It's totally useless for me.

I have seen a possible contenter that could become my next phone when it comes out at the end of the year - I'll tell you more about that when I can.
