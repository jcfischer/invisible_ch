Scripting Screencasts
---------------------

[Castanaut][1] is a DSL and library to script ScreenCasts in Ruby. Nifty!

    while_saying "To install it, drag it to your bookmarks bar." do
      move to_element("a.button")
      drag to(88, 106)
      pause 0.5
      hit Enter
    end


Scripting the Shell
-------------------

What if you could use Ruby instead of the shell? [You can][2] 

    local_dir = Rush::Box.new('localhost')['/Users/adam/server_logs/'].create servers = %w(www1 www2 www3).map { |n| Rush::Box.new(n) }
    servers.each { |s| s['/var/log/nginx/access.log'].copy_to local_dir["#{s.host}_access.log"] } 

[Rush][3] - the Ruby shell

Rapid Game Development
----------------------

Interested in developing a game in one week? I am - but I don't seem to find the time. 

A [list of resources][4] and the [post-mortem of someone actually doing it][5].

(For the moment, when I find time)
