I have a "filler project" coming up and I need to choose the right tools to get the job done. 

There's a bit of infrastructure in place: MS SQL Server, IIS and a couple of databases on the SQL server.

I need to write a web enabled front end for those, containing two forms to enter information. Also I need to be able to create reports from the database (also in HTML). 

Somebody else did the bidding and estimation so there is a lot less time than I'd like to have to spend on this project.

Luckily I can select the technology to use - but what should I choose? 

Notes/Domino is out of the question. Looking at my choices I see the following options:


  * ASP
  * PHP
  * Perl CGI
  * Python

I have seen ASP and it looks a lot like LotusScript, so I'm confident I can tackle that. I have played a bit with PHP, should be rather easy to learn. Perl - I have written some simple database related CGI stuff in my last project, so there is some familiarity. Python - I'm playing with the language and like what I see.

What would you choose in my situation?
