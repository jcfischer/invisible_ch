Ever since the [experiments with the Xen virtual server][1] (which run beautifully, thanks for asking) lot's has happend:

* It's been - oh - almost 20 years since I sat in tests for 2 times 3 hours straight. That's what I did last friday, as part of my education to become an "[Organisator][2]". The tests went well (the proof will be the results that I get next month) and I'm happy to have that behind me.
* I've been to Opera with my wife. "La Traviata" is a rather simple story, but beautiful music and a wonderful performance at the [Opernhaus Zurich][3].
* What is the best way to migrate away from a Lotus Notes application, when you need to keep some 5500 old data items? No, not importing everything into Remedy. Not building a "read-only" Ruby On Rails application. Keep the Notes Server, keep the data, let the users keep the "old way" of accessing data. Seems like a no brainer, but needed a pre-study with cost/benefit analysis.
* Organizing a new training class next week for a new customer. Im going to do a 3 days introduction to Ruby and Ruby on Rails class for 6 programmers. Unfortunately, [Rails 1.1][4] was released today, so I need to update my documentation. The [forgotten features of Rails 1.1][8] is a list of the small but important changes that also will help you
* I booked both flight and conference today: [Reboot 8.0][5] I'm coming. (And I'm looking forward to that immensely). [Henriette][6] [can I crash you][7]? Reboot7 last year seemed to me to be a turning point in my life. I am sure, that Reboot8 will have a similar impact on the way I look at life.
