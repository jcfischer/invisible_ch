Access to this site has been flaky for the last couple of days. I apologize. First of, my server decided to act up and hat to get the BRS treatment. 

Then I moved my primary domain [www.invisible.ch](http://www.invisible.ch) to [TextDrive](http://www.textdrive.com), something I have been planning to do for a long time. There isn't that much content there yet, but it will come.

Sorry for the interruption, back to normal business
