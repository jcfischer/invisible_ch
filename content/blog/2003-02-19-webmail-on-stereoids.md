OK - I'm easily impressed. But what this company has been doing to webmail is simply astounding: [Oddpost](http://www.oddpost.com) creates a Outlook like environment in the browser. Complete with type-ahead, drag&drop; and whatnot. It's fast, easy, nice. Unfortunately you need IE5+ to use it.... (Can we have Opera 7 support, please? Or Mozilla at least?)

Very, very impressive
