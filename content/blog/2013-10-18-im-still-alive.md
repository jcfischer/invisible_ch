Contrary to what the last blog post was (or wasn't suggesting) I didn't die while fasting - I just lost 7kg and the will to finish the 100 day blogging challenge (call it 95% success)

And then a Wordpress update led to me not being able to access the backend, so I couldn't blog anymore. And then a lot of other things happened in RL that just put blogging on the back burner. Luckily I have a nasty cold these days, so I could start to take care of all the small things that needed attention - like this blog for example.

I'm back, I'm alive and I have started to blog (lightly) on our company blog: [PetaBlog](https://www.switch.ch/petablog/)Â - feel free to pop over and have a look.

And so I retreat back to bed, another small task solved, with some tea.
