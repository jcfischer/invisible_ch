[RubyOnRailsWorkshops.com][1] is a web site that tracks all Rails workshops around the world. So if you'd rather go to [Los Angeles][2] than to [Zurich][3], that's the place to look.

In related news, it looks like my [Geneva Rails Workshop][4] won't be happening. So far I have one interested person (coming all the way from Denmark) but none from the Geneva area. I need at least 8 people and I need some form of interest by Wednesday 18th.
