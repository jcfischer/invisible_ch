It was Kickstarter payback day today ([yet another one](/2013/02/24/73-kickstarting/)) and two black [Pebbles](https://getpebble.com) arrived (I am still waiting for a red, a white and a gray one)

[![Pebble box](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image-e1365196775604-224x300.jpeg)](/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image-e1365196775604.jpeg)

First impressions (after half a day of wearing it):



	
  * Bigger than expected

	
  * Not as polished and small as an Apple product, but not bad - not bad at all - for  an independent company

	
  * The display is better than expected

	
  * Communication with an iPhone 4 works relatively painless (seeing phone calls, messages and music control work)

	
  * It can show the time (I haven't worn a watch for quite some time, always using the iPhone as a clock) and that is actually quite practical

	
  * The watch faces included range widely in quality, but most are nice

	
  * Notification of calls might be the killer feature for me. I have my phone on silent 99% of the time and I miss calls due to the phone vibrating in a jacket pocket where I don't feel it.


I will see how it feels after [one week](https://sojus.ch/?p=19) - that is if I get to keep it. Depends on a gift to my godchild (which color does he want) and my son (he wants a black one)
