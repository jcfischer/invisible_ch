whew. After quite some time debugging, working, sweating and swearing, we are releasing the new beta build (525) of ZAPPATA today. 

More IMAP tweaking in this release, and ZAPPATA now can run as a Windows Service. (Be sure to read the ReadmeWin.txt for some snags in this build)

You can get it here [zappata-0.4.525.exe](http://www.zappatanetworks.com/files/zappata-0.4.525.exe) (Windows Installer) or as a regular ZIP file here: [zappata-0.4.525.zip](http://www.zappatanetworks.com/files/zappata-0.4.525.zip) (multiplattform)
