A friend of mine lent me a Wacom Intuos2 Tablet for a couple of weeks. I'm looking for a Mac program (preferrably shareware) to do some illustrations. I need a vector drawing program, that can output EPS.

I have looked at [Inkscape][1] and it kind of works (X11 layer and all), but I'm sure there must be something else out there. 

Any hints?
