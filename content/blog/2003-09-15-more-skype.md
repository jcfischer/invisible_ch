After over a day where no-one called me  I finally persuaded two friends of me to give [Skype](http://www.skype.com), the "internet telephony program" a try.

Installed, made a connection, started talking and nearly fell out of my chair.

I use a Dell Inspiron 8200 Laptop with the built in mic and speakers. And the voice connection was absolutely clear, brilliant. No echo, no lag, no funny compression artifacts. The first call was with someone with a headset / mic and it was just gorgeous - better than ISDN.

The second call was to a similar laptop, also with the built in mic - and it still sounded perfect. You could hear the room at the other end, but the voice was absolutely clear.

Skype has a winner on it's hand! You can call me with my username: "jenscfischer"
