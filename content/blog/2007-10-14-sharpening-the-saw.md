> Suppose you were to come upon someone in the woods working feverishly to saw down a tree.

> "What are you doing?" you ask.

> "Can't you see?" comes the impatient reply. "I'm sawing down this tree."

> "You look exhausted!" you exclaim. "How long have you been at it?"

> "Over five hours," he returns, "and I'm beat! This is hard work."

> "Well why don't you take a break for a few minutes and sharpen that saw?" you inquire.  "I'm sure it would go a lot faster."

> "I don't have time to sharpen the saw," the man says emphatically. "I'm too busy sawing!"

Excerpt from Stephen R. Covey's "The 7 habits"

**sharpening part one**

We just returned from one week of vacation (first time in 10 years without kids - what a joy to revive the relation with my wife...) in [Muhlheim/Mosel][3] (Hotel highly recommended), [Strasbourg][4] (city is great, the "hotel" is not recommended) and finally [Colmar][5] (great hotel from 1565, great food). Even though I brought the laptop, I didn't work - and it was good.


**sharpening part two**

I have written a lot of code and a lot of text in the last months (you will read more about the writing soon), and I've gone through 3 or 4  keyboards (two white Apple keyboard; they are just lousy, a Microsoft "ergonomic 4000 something" lousy one and now one of the new Apple aluminum ones; which I adore - so far).

Still, my hands and wrists hurt a lot. Triggered by Giulio, I started to look into [Dvorak][6] and played a bit with it. Further research led me to the german biased [NEO][7] layout. I've been struggling with it for the last few days. It's a pain to unlearn 25 years of QWERTY and my current typing speed is abysmal. But there is (slow) progress. And you have to love a layout that makes it easy to type :-). 

**sharpening part three**

Watching the following, final lecture by professor [Randy Pausch][8] who has a life expectancy of 3-6 months, is an amazing experience. Carve out the 90 minutes of your day and be inspired!
