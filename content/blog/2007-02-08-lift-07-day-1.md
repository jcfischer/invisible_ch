Lift really started today and had a bunch of very different talks that I attended. I'm not even going to try to summarize them - [Stephanie][1] and [Bruno][2] are doing a wonderful, wonderful job with their notes. (I wonder how Bruno manages to attend (seemingly) every talk and publish a concise recap with pictures and links within hours. Must be that journalist thing :) - or a couple of ghost writers maybe? )

The personal highlight for me was the talk by Prof. Sugata about the [hole in the wall][3] experiments. Fascinating, fascinating. He put a computer up in slums or very rural areas of India and watched how kids in the 6-13 year age bracket educated themselves to using the computer, surfing the internet, even learning around 200 words of english - all without any intervention from teachers.

The most incoherent talk was by [Bernino Lind][4] who did an extravagant show with three guys playing the accordion, a slide show of pictures and a talk that talked about - yes - what did he talk about? 

People met: 

* [Adrian Kosmaczewski][5] - preaching Rails in Lausanne
* [John Buckmann][6] - Bookmooching and being a really nice guy (an old Lotus Notes hand, it seems :-) )
* [David Galipeau][7] - sharing fondue and white wine

and a lot of others, that I can't remember in my current - semi-catatonic state... Will be updated as necessary
