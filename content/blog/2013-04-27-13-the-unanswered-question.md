Fallout from the [Songwriting course](/2013/04/24/16-pat-pattisons-introduction-to-songwriting-recap/) was a link to [Leonard Bernsteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Bernstein) 1973 Harward Norton Lecture "[The unanswered question](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwA6LUf2OwxZ53dFAnRZXqPVodZNaoOQK)". While ironing my shirts today I watched lecture nr 2 about the syntax of music.



If you have just a passing interest in music, music theory, linguistics, the [universal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar) and [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_chomsky) and you are delighted by listening to a profound, delightful and humorous lecture, presented in the most extraordinary manner, then spend the 96 minutes to watch this and learn about the connection between speech, lyrics and music and see how Mozarts [Sonata in G Minor #40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._40_(Mozart)) is constructed.

I will be spending more time ironing in the future, there are 5 other lectures to be seen.
