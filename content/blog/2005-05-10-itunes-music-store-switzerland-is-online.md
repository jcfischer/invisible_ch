It took a while, but now it's online: The swiss (and the scandinavian) itunes music stores. The price for a track is CHF 1.50 ( around 1 Euro or 1.2 US$ - quite expensive, but this is Switzerland, where the money comes from).



Also, [version 4.8](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) of iTunes itself is available, and it's playing videos now.



Now if only the quality of the downloads would be better - [allofmp3.com](https://allofmp3.com) is much more advanced in this regard. (I'll leave the legality discussions for the moment)
