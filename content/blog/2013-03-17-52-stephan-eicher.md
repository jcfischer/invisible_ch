Last time I was at a concert of [Stephan Eicher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan_Eicher) must have been in the mid 1980s. Stephan was solo on stage with a guitar and a sampler and a box of floppy discs and after each song, he would smile shy and ask what we wanted to hear. He then proceeded to load that floppy disc and play it.

I have heard most of his music since then but never seen him life again. Until tonight.

The concert was in a [club](http://www.x-tra.ch/), relatively small. His [band](http://allblues.ch/Stephan-Eicher/1361) was small and tight  (a wonderful violinist[ Johan Renard](https://soundcloud.com/johan-renard), [Hank Shizzoe](http://www.hankshizzoe.com/) ([@HankShizzoe](https://twitter.com/HankShizzoe)) on guitars, [Baptiste Germser](http://www.myspace.com/baptistegermser) ([@bgermser](https://twitter.com/bgermser)) and [Simon Baumann](http://www.simonb.ch/index1.html) on drums). Stephan played a couple a wonderful mix of new and old songs, a fantastic set. As a child of the 80s I enjoyed his old songs "[Déjeuner en paix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujV_f65dnF8)", "[Pas d'ami comme toi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BF7YAHvo0g)", "[Combien de temps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh7J9soviHo)", "[Des hauts des bas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0sjXFoQaxs&list=AL94UKMTqg-9CUGytVAt3sJZWIKDWAJBxU)" and his covers of "[Hemmige](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohHncHGIFgM&list=AL94UKMTqg-9CUGytVAt3sJZWIKDWAJBxU)" , "[Campari Soda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFxwFGaw4wg)" and "[S'Vreneli vom Guggisberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7uHWQEHcp0)"

If you have a chance to [see them](http://www.hankshizzoe.com/english/tour/tour.html), go and do it: This has been one of the best concerts I have ever been to.

And for us old farts (stuff he didn't play, but things I still enjoy): "[MiniMiniMiniJupe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ877LI0IHU&list=AL94UKMTqg-9CUGytVAt3sJZWIKDWAJBxU)" and of course "[Les filles du Limmatquai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpjV3QRGyn0)"
