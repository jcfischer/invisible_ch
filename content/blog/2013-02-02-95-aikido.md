Every couple of months, we get a visit by one of the great Aikido masters in our Dojo. This weekend, St√©phane Benedetti, the "lazy Aikido" master.

5 hours of Aikido today for me - and I can feel every muscle and bone. Obviously, I'm doing it wrong.

Here's a video from our Dojo, from 2008 where he demonstrates principles. Enjoy (and I will take it easy the rest of the evening)
