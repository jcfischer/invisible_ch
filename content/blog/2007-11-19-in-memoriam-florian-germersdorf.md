Today at 12:35, [Florians Brain Tumor](http://blog.invisible.ch/2006/08/02/if-not-today/) finally took his life. Florian died in his sleep. I am so sad that he has left us.

In September 2006 I visited him in hospital and left [very thoughtful](http://blog.invisible.ch/2006/09/19/not-productive/). That day I said I'd write a book, if I knew I only had a year left to live. I actually do hope, I have a bit more time, but it turns out, I  got my chance. All going well, my book on Rails development "[Ruby on Rails in der Praxis](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3826616839?ie=UTF8&tag=invisiblech-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=3826616839)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.de/e/ir?t=invisiblech-21&l=as2&o=3&a=3826616839)" will be published in January 2008.

Thank you, Florian - for your friendship and everything. We miss you!
