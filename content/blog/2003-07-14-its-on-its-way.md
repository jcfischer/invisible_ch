![ipod-shipped.gif](http://www.invisible.ch/images/ipod-shipped.gif)Only two days after I ordered it, it's already on it's way from the factory at Taiwan. Wonder how fast it's going to be here... 
My first piece of Apple equipment - ever since I had to program Modula-2 back on the Mac's at the technical university. Now this little piece won't do any computations, but it will keep me entertained....
Joy!
