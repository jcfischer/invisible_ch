A most excellent [article on the technical details](https://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/1) of Apple's OS X 10.4. There's a lot more changes than meet the eye. Interesting reading on kernel locks, file meta-data, Quartz architecture and loads of other things. And a pleasant difference to the many "Spotlight/Dashboard, so-what's really new" articles that I've been seeing the last weeks.
