Yes - new year, new rails!

Rails 1.2.1 has been released... Get it through the ususal

    $ sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies

There's a [summary][1] over on DHH's blog. On to new borders... And I guess it's time to get to work on updating the [Rails reference][2] - stay tuned, this will take a few days.
