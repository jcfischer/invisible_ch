Not content of just having a blog or a wiki, Martin Fowler rolled his own [Bliki](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/).

Back when I started my blog, I used Steve Pikes PikiePikie, which was a wiki with blog functionality. Sadly, Steve seems to have given up on development. His server has been down for a loooong time.

_Update:_ There seems to be life in PikiePikie yet: Go to the new[HomePage of PikiePikie](http://pikie.webbing.nl/cgi-bin/pikie.cgi?HomePage)

You can still check my Pikie out [here](/cgi-bin/pikie)
