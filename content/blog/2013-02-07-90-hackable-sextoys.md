Todays takeaway of Lift13?

Hackable Sextoys via the presentation by [@PerfectPlum](http://twitter.com/PerfectPlum)

Besides showing of and demonstrating the current state of the art in vibrator technology, Heather Kelly also showed hackable sextoys (for example [a vibrator controlled by an ultrasonic transducer](http://scanlime.org/2012/11/hacking-my-vagina/) that measures the distance of an object to the sensors and intensifies the vibrations accordingly)

A great presentation, and an interesting topic (especially after [Garions](https://twitter.com/garionh) talk about [themes in the adult industry](http://de.slideshare.net/garionh/garion-hall-adultindustryliftfeb2013v12) and  his social responsible [adult website](http://abbywinters.com)  and his admittance that he didn't know, what women would be interested in)
