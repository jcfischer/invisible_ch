I said: Don't! Don't go to [CrazyMachines](https://www.crazy-machines.com/). Don't download the demo. Don't play it. Don't rush out and buy the game... [1]

If you do and live in a country other than "Deutschland (Deutschland)" (like "Deutschland (Schweiz)" you will get errors when installing (An error about "Transform" and "Transformpfade"). Just switch to the "Deutschland (Deutschland) scheme and you'll be fine for the install)

Also if you do: prepare to spend a couple of hours in front of the computer, not working
