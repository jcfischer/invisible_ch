It's absolutely unbelievable, how little it takes to make a good design. Actually, it's unbelievable, how much it takes to make so little.



The [Mighty Mouse](https://www.apple.com/mightymouse/) is such a thing. While I haven't seen it yet, or actually laid hands on it, it seems to me, reading the descriptions, that the designers have put a lot of thought into this. Items like the left/right finger detector. The built in speaker for audible feedback. The roll-thing (I wonder how this compares to the IBM version of old, where a tracking-point was used instead of a wheel -- I never got the hang of that and didn't like it). The squeeze buttons.



I'm really looking forward to try and use this. 



It's amazing, that Apple can make a mouse and I feel a sudden urge to get it asap.
