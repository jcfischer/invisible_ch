I've had a [Barix](http://www.barix.com) [Exstreamer](http://www.exstreamer.com) for quite a while. It has been sitting in my bedroom, mostly not playing. One of the reasons was the the server software (zServer) that Barix provides isn't quite to my liking. 

Barix has since made zServer open-source and I have started to work on it (something that unfortunately I don't have too much time for at the moment). 

But on the Exstreamer Mailing list, someone mentioned [Streamsicle](http://streamsicle.com/) as an alternative. This piece of software is a streaming server that jukeboxes through my mp3 collection on my home theater PC. Re-configuring the Exstreamer was a snap and now it sits and happily plays through my collection.

Streamsicle has a really slick [web interface](http://www.invisible.ch/images/streamsicle.html).
