This morning my trusty P800 wouldn't let me work at all. Programs weren't starting, couldn't open contacts (Disk Full message).
I switched it off and then on - and was greeted with "your disk is corrupt - I will format it to fix the problem". GREAT
Really great - after formatting the disk, my phone started working again but was back to pristine conditions - no contacts, no calendar entries, no nothing.
I'm wondering over the stupidity of the Symbian OS to treat a disk full condition with this harsh reaction.
Luckily the P800 software let's you backup your phone - unfortunately my last backup was almost one month old.
And as avid readers know, I've had [problems syncing with Lotus Notes](http://www.invisible.ch/archives/000071.html) for a long time now.
I took the opportunity to download the newest [PC software for the P800 (german)](http://www.sonyericsson.com/downloads/PCSuiteForP800_rel_1.5.1_DE.exe) and then noted [this answer to my query on Notes.net](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/46dom.nsf/55c38d716d632d9b8525689b005ba1c0/c40069661039748c85256d3400313c6f?OpenDocument) helped me to get Synching of the p800 with Lotus Notes working again: I had to remove every trace of the old PC Suite from the system. I also removed all traces of it in the registry, re-installed the 1.5.1 software, set up the synch options - and voila - it worked.
Incredible. Technology at it's best. Grmpfl
