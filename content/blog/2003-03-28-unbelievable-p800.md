I got it - today I got a call, that my SonyEricsson P800 was waiting for me....

What a nice phone! I'm playing around with it and trying to get it to sync all my adresses and calendar items. I managed to get my addresses over from Outlook, but no go on the calendar front. Also some program complains all the time that Outlook is not the default mail client - by god - NO of course not. Now I'm in the process of moving my adresses and calendar entries to Lotus Notes - the adresses synced perfectly - let's see how the calendar goes.
