I've had my share of slow down's on this Dell Inspiron 8200 (read about the [adventures with the taskmanager](http://www.invisible.ch/archives/000151.html) in Windows XP). 
Yesterday I installed Red Hat 9 on the same machine and it seemed incredibly slow - especiall loading stuff. Talking to my colleagues, 
    
    hdparm

was mentioned... Maybe the harddisk was in PIO mode? Well - it turns out - it isn't - nevertheless I tweaked the parameters a bit. Here's my current setting:

    
    /sbin/hdparm -X69 -d1 -u1 -m16 -c3 /dev/hda


Booting back to Windows XP I looked at the device manager. And there: The first IDE device was set to use PIO mode. No wonder, my eXPerience hasn't been stellar the last couple of weeks. Resetting this is actually quite difficult: You can toggle the "Use DMA, if possible" setting, but XP happily ignores it.
The correct way to do it? 


  * Remove the first IDE adapter, reboot
  * let XP recognize IDE adapter, Harddisk and DVD. Reboot
  * Check the Device manager: The disk now should operate in UltraDMA5 mode
It still feels slow though....
