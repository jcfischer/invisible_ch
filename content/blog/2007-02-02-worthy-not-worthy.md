I'm taking after my late father, who loved photography, cameras and taking pictures. I lust for a DSLR (like the [Pentax K10D][1] for example). However, I'm not sure I'm worthy... The skill of good photography is not due to the size or the quality of the camera, but the eye of the photographer. And I have the feeling, that my dinky point-and-shoot Panasonic Lumix would do just fine. People like [Dannie Jost][3] make terrific photos - even with a cell phone.

So here's my pledge: If I manage to take a couple of good pictures next week at [Lift07][2] with the Lumix I will go for the DSLR. If not, I will look for a different hobby.
