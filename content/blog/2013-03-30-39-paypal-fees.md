Just a quick note of outrage. I was planning to send EUR 150 to Germany for some guitar gear.

As this wasn't a commercial transaction, I choose to foot the bill in terms ofÂ commissions. PayPal wanted to take EUR 7.70 (or a bit over 5%) for this transfer. 5% - that is outrageously expensive... Time for someone to step up to the plate and provide an alternative...

Oh - [wait](https://mobino.com)...
