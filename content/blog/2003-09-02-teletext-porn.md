I already rank nr 3 on the [google search for ascii porn](https://www.google.com/search?q=ascii+porn&sourceid=opera&num=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8), so I figured I could top this of with a [link to a view on teletext](https://radio.weblogs.com/0100875/2003/08/31.html#a988) found via [marc's voice](https://blogs.it/0100198/): [Teletext Porn](https://a-blast.org/~drx/lo-tech/teletext/index.en.html).

Oh -- and those that have been waiting for some update on new HTML designs - bear with me. A project has been hitting the fan - and I'm facing the task of redoing some 15'000 links manually in an application, if I can't find the cure to do it programatically...
