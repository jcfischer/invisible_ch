We knew that Solaris DTrace would be included in OS X 10.5 (Leopard). And of course there was much speculation, that some other Solaris technologies would make it into the next OS X version.

It [seems that ZFS is going to be included][1]. This is great news. I've been reading about [ZFS][2] for quite some time, and notably my favorite hoster, [Textdrive/Joyent][3] has been using ZSF for quite a bit. [benr][4] (Ben Rockwood) has blogged quite a bit about the positive aspects of ZFS. 

I'm thrilled by this news. It seems that there is no comparable filesystem around at the moment. It's great to see, that Apple includes selected pieces of really great software from other vendors like Sun.
