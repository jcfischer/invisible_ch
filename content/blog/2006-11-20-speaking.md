Next week, I have two speaking engagements:

On monday, the 27. I will be speaking at [tekzone][1] and sitting in on a panel about "Beyond Java" and speaking on the virtues of Ruby and Rails. If you are in Zurich at that time, drop in (free registration required).

On Wednesday and Thursday (29.11 and 30.11) I'll be holding a [workshop about the Synology][2] products. 

I look forward to both. Writing presentations is something I really like to do. And I simply love presenting - even though I will be nervous.

If you're at one of these events, be sure to say hi.
