[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) is a huge time and money sink - all those nifty projects, great ideas, great artists...

Last year I spent way too much money on nice projects, some of them turned out to be not so hot as thought ([CordCruncher](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1587181400/cordcruncher-earbud-headphones), I'm looking at you)

But today, coming back from holidays, saw the letter with the [Nifty minidrive](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1342319572/the-nifty-minidrive), and earlier today I got the email with the link to download the beta version of [Drifter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/celsiusgs/drifter-a-space-trading-game). Last year I received the gorgeous [album by Amanda Palmer](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amandapalmer/amanda-palmer-the-new-record-art-book-and-tour)Â (and got to see her live later)

Still waiting for the [Pebble](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android), [Space Command](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/58936338/space-command), [Republique](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/486250632/republique-by-camouflaj-logan), [Elite: Dangerous](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous), [Light Table](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table) and [Memoto](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/martinkallstrom/memoto-lifelogging-camera). On IndieGoGo, I'm waiting for the [Misfit Shine](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/270243/x/1828302).

I absolutely adore the idea of kickstarting projects, and I must hold myself back forcefully in order not to spend way too much money on all of these good ideas...
