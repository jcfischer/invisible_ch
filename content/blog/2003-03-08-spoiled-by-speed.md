Here I am at my Wife's Sisters computer, trying to fix a printer that no longer prints black. ([Google](https://groups.google.com/groups?q=canon+s400+black+not+printing&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&sa=N&tab=wg) tells me that the printhead probably is clogged with dried black ink)

Anyway - I'm accessing the Internet to diagnose this problem - nothing special there. But I'm doing so, using a 56k Modem. God - how can anybody bear that kind of slowness? Have I really drooled back in the old days, when I got my first 2400 baud, my first 14'400 baud modem? Nowadays, anything under 512kb speed just seems unbearable... (and then you also have to wait until the modem has dialed, negotiated, etc. - I'm so used to being always on)

Times change fast...
