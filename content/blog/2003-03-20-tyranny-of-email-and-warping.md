Thanks to [Ned](http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/) for sharing this link to [The Tyranny of email](http://w-uh.com/index.cgi/articles/030308-tyranny_of_email.html). It contains some good thought - like the three hour rule:



<blockquote>
I maintain that programming cannot be done in less than three-hour windows.Â  It takes three hours to spin up to speed, gather your concentration, shift into "right brain mode", and really focus on a problem.Â  Effective programmers organize their day to have at least one three-hour window, and hopefully two or three.Â  (This is why good programmers often work late at night.Â  They don't get interrupted as much...)
