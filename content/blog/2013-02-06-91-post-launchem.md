[Lift 13](https://liftconference.com) started today - early for Alvaro and me, who took the [Roeschtigrabenexpress](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23roesti13) from Zurich to Geneva. Thanks Glenn and [stimmt AG](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23roesti13) for a wonderful ride.

The rest of the day is kind of blurry in my mind. We launched, took money from people, fixed a few small issues, and generally studied how the people reacted to Mobino.

The joyous moment of the day for me was to witness one guy buying a coffee at the bar, paying with Mobino for the first time ever and exclaiming: "C'est super cool" - that makes all the trials and tribulations we went through worth it. We also heard good things from others (merchants and users) - fantastic to see our ideas validated this way.

We got tons of great feedback, and we will try to issue updated versions of the app as soon as possible.

The evening saw the traditional fondue, re-meeting good friends and winding down.

You will excuse, gentle reader, that I won't write more today - it was a long journey to get to the point where we are now.
