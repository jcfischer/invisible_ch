[PragProg](https://www.pragprog.com) features Dave and Andy who wrote two wonderful books.... Dave has some thoughts about [Code Kata's](https://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata).

I'm a student of Karate myself, so this rang a bell for me. I will think about this some more, when I'm more awake than right now ;-)

Oh - [Andy](https://www.toolshed.com/blog) is blogging too
