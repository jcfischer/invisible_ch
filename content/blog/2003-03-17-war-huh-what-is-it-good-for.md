So it seems that tomorrow is the night the war begins (full moon rising, one day after the "ultimatum"). I didn't grow up when the saying was "Make love, not war". When I was a young adult, we watched war on CNN and heard that making love was dangerous (AIDS). "Make War, not Love" seemed to be the motto. 

And now the time has come again... I'm saddend by this, angry. 

Here are some of the things that make me laugh, cry or wanting to vomit:

[Bush: Our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity is finally over](http://www.theonion.com/onion3701/bush_nightmare.html)  (The Onion, 2001)  

[Back to Iraq](http://www.back-to-iraq.com/) (independet journalism blogging)   

[View from the gunport of an AC-130](http://www.back-to-iraq.com/archives/000123.php#000123) (ever wanted to see people running for their lifes and getting blown up? Watch this and be sick)
