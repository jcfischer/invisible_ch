I'm working on a large spreasheet that builds a [trackrecord](http://www.ivorix.com/en/track/index.html) of my other [companies](http://www.ivorix.com/) financial product. Without a formal education in Excel (and not being one of those people that read books about standard products ;-) ) my use of excel formulae was limited to the mere basic stuff.

Then I needed to reverse the contents of a column. Googling a bit, I found the article [Working with lists](http://www.cpearson.com/excel/lists.htm) and a whole lot of related stuff.

I learnt that you can [name individual cells or ranges](http://www.cpearson.com/excel/named.htm), about [Array formulas](http://www.cpearson.com/excel/array.htm) (that loop over ranges - ohh - if only I had known before - my life would have been so much easier)

[Chip Pearson](http://www.cpearson.com/excel.htm) does a truly amazing job in explaing advanced excel techniques. Thanks!
