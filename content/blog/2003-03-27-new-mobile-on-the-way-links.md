My old mobile phone is starting to break down - time for a new one. After some thoughts, I decided to buy the [SonyEricsson P800](http://www.sonyericsson.com/ch/spg.jsp?page=start) which got a [good review on Geek.com](http://www.geek.com/hwswrev/pda/p800/index.htm) and not too many complaints on the [Usenet](http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=p800&btnG=Google+Search&meta=group%3Dalt.cellular.ericsson). All going well, I should have it tomorrow (but then, most of the time, things don't go well...)

What I like about the P800, is that it's possible to develop your own apps - I'm planning to take a look at doing some Java coding on it... (time permitting).
