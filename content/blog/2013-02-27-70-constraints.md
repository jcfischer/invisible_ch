Constraints set us free.

Or at least they can stimulate creative energy and make us try to do things differently. In todays improvisation workshop, Omri had us work with a lot of constraints:

Make 3 pieces of music, 1 or 2 minutes each, where you are not allowed to make a sound that sounds as if it comes from your instrument.

Improvise on the piano (something that is interesting to listen to) using just 2 notes. ... using just one note

Write 15 poems, each with 15 words

Build a production ready system, but you have no budged

Write a blog post each day for 100 days

Constraints are good for you - embrace them!
