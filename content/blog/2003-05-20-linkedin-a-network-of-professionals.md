**Updated with more links**

I like networking. I like the idea, that everybody is connected to everyone else through not more than six other people. I was a member of sixdegrees.com - but never got much use out of it. Anyway - there's a new company, [LinkedIn, Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com) that offers this kind of networking. It's aimed at realizing networks of professionals - and it has a number of safeguards against spamming, and unwanted contacts.

There's a description of the [Web of Trust](https://www.corante.com/many/20030501.shtml#33458) that lies behind such systems on [Many-to-many](https://www.corante.com/many) list.

_Update:_ There's a very active and interesting [discussion on Joi's site](https://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/05/11/example_of_usefulness_of_linkedin.html) with the founder of LinkedIn offering background information on design, user reactions etc. It's is very interesting to see how this is going to develop.

Joi has also created a [LinkedIn Wiki Page](https://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/LinkedIn) that has more information and more links.

[Marc Canter has an email discussion about LinkedIn](https://blogs.it/0100198/2003/05/09.html)

[Elizabeth Lane Lawley has criticism](https://www.it.rit.edu/~ell/mamamusings/archives/000445.html)



Let's see how this develops...
