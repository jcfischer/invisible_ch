I haven't had a chance to read until just now - and I'm deeply impressed how Robin Cook expressed his views on the war, on Britains role and on some of the background. Read [the speech](https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2859431.stm), at BBC's site.



<blockquote>
Ironically, it is only because Iraq's military forces are so weak that we can even contemplate its invasion. Some advocates of conflict claim that Saddam's forces are so weak, so demoralised and so badly equipped that the war will be over in a few days. 

We cannot base our military strategy on the assumption that Saddam is weak and at the same time justify pre-emptive action on the claim that he is a threat. 

Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood sense of the term - namely a credible device capable of being delivered against a strategic city target. 

It probably still has biological toxins and battlefield chemical munitions, but it has had them since the 1980s when US companies sold Saddam anthrax agents and the then British Government approved chemical and munitions factories.
