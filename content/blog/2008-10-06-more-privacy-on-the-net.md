Following up on my piece '[the private net](/2008/10/01/the-private-net/)' from last week, some further thoughts on secure communications and a call to action:

One secure way of communication, supposedly, is Skype. I have heard law enforcement people in Switzerland talk about their problems with Skype: They can't monitor and eavesdrop on the encrypted communication. But is it really true? Some people I have talked to suggest that the price EBay paid for Skype a few years ago was way way more, than the business was worth. Might it be, these people speculated, that US agencies had an interest to get Skype under US control?

A few months ago, there were [speculations on a backdoor](https://www.privacydigest.com/2008/07/26/speculation+over+possible+wiretap+back+door+skype). And just recently we found out, that [Skype is censcored in China](https://share.skype.com/sites/en/2008/10/skype_president_addresses_chin.html) and that there is a security breach too. 

I know of at least one P2P alternative to Skype: [GridIM](https://www.grid-evolution.com/)(but haven't gotten that too work yet). Are there others? There must be, and it would be good, if we would start using the alternatives. Preferably Open-Source... Lazyweb? Any pointers?

And finally the call for action: If you are in Berlin for [Web 2.0 Expo](https://europe.web2expo.com/), hunt me down and let's talk. Maybe there is a movement waiting to be born: [Take back the net](mailto:info@take-back-the-net.org).
