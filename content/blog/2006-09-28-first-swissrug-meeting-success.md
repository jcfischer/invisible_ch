The inaugural meeting of SwissRUG / Zurich.rb / bunch of geeks was quite a success, with 16 people turning up. Due to some communications gone bad, the restaurant only had reserved a table for 10, but by grabbing the employees table, we managed to squeeze all in. 

Quite a mixed bunch of people: The operating systems seemed neatly divided into 1/3 Windows, 1/3 Mac OS X and 1/3 Linux. About half of the people earn money using Ruby and/or Rails. There were quite a few "Ruby only" people.

A lot of individual discussions were taking place and I think that all participants enjoyed themselves. We are going to meet again, presumably at the end of October. Venue and time will be communicated...
