[Mike Clark][1] has an incredible powerfull idea: [Learning through testing][2]. He describes how he uses unit tests to learn a programming language (Ruby in this case). Each unit test encapsulates a bit of language knowledge he has aquired. 

Writing the unit tests, he explores a bit of the language. Also, there's a written trail of things he has done and explored. 

I find this an extremely compelling way of learning a language and keeping track of what you know, so I guess this will go into my: "Things to try out" stack.
