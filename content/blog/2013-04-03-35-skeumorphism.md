Every Apple user will have met [Skeumorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) - faux leather in the calendar, tape reels in the (old) Podcast iOS app etc. There is hope, that [Jonny Ive will free OSX and iOS from the tired "trying to look like reality" look](https://daringfireball.net/2013/01/the_trend_against_skeuomorphism).

The worst offenders in terms of skeumorphic interfaces however aren't coming from Cupertino - there are legion of software producers that build interfaces that mimic "reality" down to the shadows on the knobs. Check out these samples:

While these interfaces might look nice, I find them (in general) to be really difficult to work with. Twiddling knobs with a mouse is just plain unpractical. Sliders are a bit better, but also quite difficult to operate.

Luckily, there are alternatives (at least some). The [DAW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) I am using, [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/),  is very light on skeumorphism. Yes - the main tracking and mixing area has sliders like on a mixing board, but most other things are blessed with sensible input controls. Thanks for that!

I do wonder though, why the electronic music industry thinks that skeumorphism is a good thing. Ideas?
