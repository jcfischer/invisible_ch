Yep, I can manage the occasional SELECT * FROM some_table; and even one or two constructs more. But I haven't had a formal education in SQL (me being a Lotus Notes guy. ("Redundancy is good").



The [GalaxQL](https://sol.gfxile.net/galaxql.html) program is a wonderful introduction to SQL and covers quite a bit more than just the WHERE statement. It's fun, it's visual, it's free and it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.



Go get it, if you need a brush up on SQL.
