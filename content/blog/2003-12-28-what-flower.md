[Yesterday](http://vowe.net/archives/003963.html) I understood the lyrics of a song by [Laurie Anderson](http://www.laurieanderson.com/) that I have been fond of for about 20 years. Sometimes I take a while longer...



<blockquote>The man walks into the flowershop and asks:  

_What flower best expreses the passing of time, days go by endlessly, pulling you into the future..._  

And the florist says: _White Lily_</blockquote>
