Well, well, well. There is this company called [43things.com](http://joshp.typepad.com/15/2005/06/finding_6_stran.html) that provides a neat web service. And suddenly there's a [german company called aimido](http://www.aimido.de) that does the same thing. [Josh Petersen](http://joshp.typepad.com/15/2005/06/finding_6_stran.html) of 43things blogged about it.



Who are [David Kuczek](http://www.kuczek.de/) and Berit Ernst? Why are they seemingly stealing the idea, the layout and the functionality of another companies business? 



What happened to having your own ideas? Do their partners, [Andreas Arntzen](http://handelsblatt.com/pshb/fn/relhbi/sfn/buildhbi/cn/GoArt!200012,201197,910061/SH/0/depot/0/), [Lars Langusch](http://www.holtzbrinck.com/ger/karriere/kar_ei_startup_portr.html), [Harald Schropfer](http://at.titu.de/) and [Oliver Weyergraf](http://www2.ebay.com/aw/de/200506021317252.html) know that their business is looking like it was lifted 1:1 from someone else? (who, by the way also have a [german presence](http://de.43things.com/)) Do they care? Or is it totally intentional?

Googling a bit, finds [this press relase](http://www.aimido.de/files/Pressemitteilung_Aimido_24_05_2005.pdf) which, as you can see is titled "42 Dinge" (or for those that can't read german: "42 things". What a coincidence to the 43 things of - 43things.com



Interesting, interesting.... Lets' see what these people with their "hohe Grunderkompetenz" are going to say, when more people see how innovative they really are.
