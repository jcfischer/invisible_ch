We are almost back to normal here at Mobino dev center, and I wanted to share a video with you, that was made at Lift13 by [Charbax](http://armdevices.net/2013/02/07/mobino-mobile-payments-system/) and in a few minutes shows you both how the payment process with Mobino works, and some thoughts from our CEO about the product and were we are heading.



Choice quotes from JF Groff include "credit cards are from the 60s" and "sorry, we don't need you"...

In the meantime - back to work, there is a ton of things to do.
