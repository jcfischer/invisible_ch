I grudingly accepted a change in ADSL plan [last week](http://www.invisible.ch/archives/000179.html) and was looking forward to 512/512 soon.

Until 5 minutes ago, when I got a call from my ADSL ISP. The lady told me, that my phone lines wouldn't be able to handle 512 upload, so I had the choice of staying (staying? You sent me a letter last week that told me I had to change) at 1024/256 - but for an additional CHF 100 per month. Or I could go to 512/280 (which seems to be the best upload speed I can get) for - get this - the same price as they are offering 512/512. 

And to top things of, she told me that the 256 upload speed I was "enjoying" now actually only was 192. But that the 280 in the future would really be 280.

I'm fuming. There is nothing [Econophone](http://www.econophone.ch) can do about this - they have to buy the ADSL lines and service from our monopoly [Swisscom](http://www.swisscom.ch). And they control the last mile to my flat. It's time that the Bundesrat acts up and frees the last mile!
