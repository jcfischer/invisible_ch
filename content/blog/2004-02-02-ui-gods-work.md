Confession: I don't run a virus scanner. I had one and it brought my system to a crawl. I deleted it. But then I don't use Outlook, I don't use IE so I think I'm pretty safe... And so far, that seems to hold true.

With all the MyDoom brouha going on, I thought it was a good idea to scan my PC for this worm(s), so I used the Symantec scanner that they offer for free download. After a couple of hours trashing around on my harddisk, it finally completed, resulting in the following screen:

Hmm - no Stop button... OK, let's Cancel.

And... The UI gods at work... Clicking on either Yes or No brings you back to the original screen.

Dont' they ever test their things?
