I'm sitting and watching an [amazing screencast][1] that shows, how [Ruby Quiz 84][2] (computing and printing [Pascals Triangle][3]) is solved, using a [test driven development][4] approach. Not only is it a good show of how TDD works, but it also shows the power of [TextMate][5] (THE editor on Mac OS X) but also the beauty of Ruby code.

It's long (about an hour), but worth watching!
