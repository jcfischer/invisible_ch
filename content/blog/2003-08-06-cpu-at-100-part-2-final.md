The friendly people over on [Joi's](http://joi.ito.com/) IRC channel [#joiito](http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel) helped me by having me look at the Task Manager "Show Kernel Process" option. Then I wandered through the options and saw that the update frequence of the graph display was set to to "stopped". Still wondering why it continued to show 100% CPU even when there was nothing going on.

Setting the graph to update regularly, showed me that my system is in a normal state... Pheeew
