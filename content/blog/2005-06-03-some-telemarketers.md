Lately, I have been the target of telemarketers. Wine, interesting and money-saving business ideas, investment ideas, what not.



Today another phone call with a suppressed number:



_"Fischer"_ I answer (that being my name). 
  
_"Good morning, this is so and so, from the company this and this, do I speak with <my wifes name>"_
  
_"Do I sound like her?"_ I ask
  
Telemarketer fast forwards in her script
  
_"I'm sorry for taking up your time.... yada yada yada - goodbye" _and hangs up



That was an easy one ....
