The coming Web 2.0 Expo in Berlin (October 21.-23.) is hosting a lot of interesting speakers on a lot of topics "web 2.0".

I just did a 25 minute interview with [Lee Bryant](http://www.headshift.com/mt/mt-cp.cgi?__mode=view&blog_id=3&id=20) of [headshift](http://headshift.com/about/overview.php) on various topics. We talk about Web 2.0, how social tools can be adopted by the enterprises, what changes might be coming, what the various obstacles are, what role collaboration tools like twitter have and how they can evolve to support enterprise collaboration.

An interesting and stimulating talk: [Lee Bryant - Web 2.0](http://invisible.bingodisk.com/public/Lee_Bryant_web20.mp3) (32 MB)
