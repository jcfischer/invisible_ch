[Jef Raskin](https://www.jefraskin.com) [commented on my mini-review](https://www.invisible.ch/archives/000155.html) of his book "The Humane Interface" and provided a link to the [demo of the zooming interface](https://humane.sourceforge.net/the/zoom.html).

It's a interactive flash movie, that shows a Zooming User Interface at work. I'm not sure, if the ZUI realy is THE way to represent a large amount of data or not. It seems to be easy enough, but I wonder if this is the right metaphor? On the other hand, Jef has quite a bit more experience with this than I do, so I bow to his expertise. Oh - and in the demo, the missing screenshot of the humane editor is included (and it's also on the website)
