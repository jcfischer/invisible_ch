The [offer](http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=1827&p=1) that [Dean](http://www.textism.com) is making is quite good. 

The business model is intersting too - instead of opting for VC funding, Dean is searching out 200 customers to start with. Each pays $199 and get's lifetime (of Deans new company lifetime that is) webhosting. 1 GB of disk, 10 GB / month of traffic. Good technical specs.

I have signed up for [TextDrive](http://www.textdrive.com/) and will be migrating my web sites to it peu a peu.
