[Brain Dish](https://www.napa.ufl.edu/2004news/braindish.htm) is the description of an experiment at Florida University. 25'000 brain cells from a rat brain, "living" in a Petri dish are hooked up to a flight simulator and "learn" to fly a F-22 jet.

In a way, I'm thrilled by this. I have been working with [neural networks](https://www.ivorix.com/en/products/tech/ki/ki.html) in the [financial world](https://www.ivorix.com/en/products/nsf/versions.html) and we have quite some experience with what neural networks can accomplish. That a organic neural network can master flight is somehow the logical conclusion and somewhat expected. 

On the other hand, it goes against what we have come to believe: That humans are somehwo superior, that intelligence is a facet of humanity. 

We are living in interesting times.
