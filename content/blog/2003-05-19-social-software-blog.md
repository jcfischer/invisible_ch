I stumbled over the [Many-to-many blog](https://www.corante.com/many/) when I dug into the background of [LinkedIn Network](/archives/000074.html). I've since started to read more on the blog and - well - it's interesting reading.

I have been working with Lotus Notes for over 13 years now - and I think Notes defined some of the aspects of "social software". I know that I spent many hours battling perceptions about "the dangers of open communications" in the early days of Notes. 

I'm coming back to social software I feel. I have spent too much time on hacking the last couple of years (anyone need a specialist in Intranet Portals?) but the thing that really is interesting to me, is the interaction between people, with people.
