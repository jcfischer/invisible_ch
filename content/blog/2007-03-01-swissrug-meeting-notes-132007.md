Just 9 people met this time for the SwissRug meeting, but we had some really interesting demos and discussions....

Florian Hanke started of by showing a little application he had thrown together to get his computer to speak to him (a childhood dream). It's called "James" and based on the [speech recognition and synthesis][1] of Mac OS X, couple with the [ruby cocoa][2] bridge. In just a couple of lines of Ruby. He's planning to build an extensible open source application for interacting with the Mac. In his demo, he was able to get a time table for the train through the [SBB][3] website. Impressive!

[Mirko Stocker][4] showed the work he and his team made for getting [Ruby refactoring suppport][5] into [RDT][6] and eventually into [RadRails][7]. The refactorings he presented looked good - the team had covered about a dozen refactorings and hope to continue their work and move into the world of refactoring Rails applications.

[Georg Kunz][8] and [Franco Sebregondi][9] were talking briefly about their [Coding Weekend][10] which is planned to happen somewhere in April, hopefully in Rapperswil. We talked about possible different projects that could be done by small groups of people over a long weekend. There are a couple of great ideas floating around (see the wiki page, and add your own ideas). 

There were a number of discussions - about Web frameworks (two of the participants are writing their own), about PHP refactorings, and all the usual banter going on, when a bunch of geeks meets.

Oh - and to prove geekdom, we had pizza instead of going out. 

The next SwissRug meeting will be held in around 6-8 weeks time - hope to see you there!
