[reboot 9.0][1] is happening on May 31st and June 1st this year. I attended both reboot 7.0 and reboot 8.0 and both have been wonderful experiences (reboot 7 being the proverbial "kick in the ass"). 

reboot 9.0 has a wonderful feature on it's website: After registering, participants are asked to tag themselves with up to 10 keywords. Later they can relate to other people, talks, ideas that share those keywords.

I chose those things in my [profile][2]:

* Doing
* Sharing
* Friendship
* Trust
* Curiosity
* Joy
* Social
* Peer
* Beauty
* Simplicity

And then there's the "Try me" button. It lists' people / suggestions / articles. And out of the 148 people that so far have registered, it lists among others: [Henriette][3], [Olle][4], [Dannie][5], [Laurent][6], [Mark][7], [Martin][8], [Matthias][9], [Peter][10], [Colin][11], [Stephanie][12], [Thomas][13].

I'm seriously impressed by this. As a friend once said: 

> There is no such thing as coincidence. It's called synchronicity

In this case, I'm happy to share a synced space on our common timeline. I'm looking forward to meeting you all in Copenhagen soon. (And I guess, I'll have to check out the others on my suggested list...)
