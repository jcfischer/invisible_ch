The last couple of days were quite a ride: Crashing applications on production servers, family woes after 25 years of not talking to each other, my server that died on saturday, a DNS move, a business critical application that stopped working at the customers site on friday and we got it working again at noon today.

And last but not least I finally saw [Fahrenheit 9/11](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/) which came on TV today. 

I had read [Michale Moore](https://www.michaelmoore.com)'s books and I had seen [Bowling for Columbine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310793/) a couple of months ago so I thought I was prepared for Fahrenheit 9/11. But still, I wasn't. [1] Seeing how much lies have been spread by the Bush administration, how much fear and hatred they have spread, how many lives their actions have cost makes me sick. I can only hope that more than 50% of the american people will give this man and his pack of advisors "the boot in the arse" they so rightfully deserve.

Make the world a better place, please, vote for Kerry.

Ok, I'll step down from my soap box now...

[1] Yes I know that Fahrenheit 9/11 isn't fair to Bush. That Moore exaggerates. That certain facts are taken out of context. That there probably are things that could be argued. But the important facts are there: Bush is a lying, self-righteous bastard.
