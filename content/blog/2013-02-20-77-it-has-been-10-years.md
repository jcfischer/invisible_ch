[10 years ago](/2003/02/18/apache-slow-down-solved/) (actually 10 years and 2 days ago - but Wordpress missed the scheduled release date of this post, so here it is - manually published)

And I had a blog before that (Moveable Type based) and still another one (written in Python). Sadly, they no longer exist...

That makes me one of the older bloggers in Switzerland, even though I haven't been as active as others (like[ Steph with her Climb to the Stars](https://climbtothestars.org/) blog)

So why did I start a blog, and why have I revived it after a hiatus that lasted a couple of years?

My first presences on the internet were handcrafted HTML pages, written at a time when I still owned the domain jcf.ch (that I sadly lost due to neglect of the colleague who organized the domain for me), probably written in some arcane text editor on OS/2. Before that I was active on FidoNet and ran a mailbox (and an astronomical high phone bill), and on Compuserve. I have had an online identity since at least 1986 in one form or another. Starting a blog felt just the right thing to do - and so I did.

I have always met fantastic people in real life due to my online activities - Sysop meetings with hard disk throwing contests in Germany, Fido meetups in Eindhoven, the [ColoradOS/2](https://www.softwaresummit.com/) (I even [talked about Lotus Notes programming there in 1996](https://www.os2ezine.com/v1n13/euros2b.htm)) that was born out from discussions on CompuServe, the Lotusphere conferences. And post blog of course [Reboot](https://www.reboot.dk/) and [Lift](https://liftconference.com) and the various Rails conferences I have been to and talked at.

Lately, the rise of Twitter (I'm an almost early adopter there, I joined 2171 days ago in March 2007) and Facebook (definitively a late adopter on that one) have sapped most of my online updates and activities. But blogging is so much more than just a "what am I doing in 140 characters". It gives me (If I'm so inclined) the space to collect a bit more of what I'm thinking about, to write down my thoughts, sometimes even distill them into something worthwhile reading. I have however always treated blogging as a self centered activity. I don't blog for others in general (but I'm delighted if you read and comment) and I don't think about what would or would not please my readers. In the beginning I blogged a couple of links (some of them are still very popular according to the Google searches that bring new readers here) but that has been delegated to Twitter.

I'm also a firm believer in owning your stuff on the Internet. I don't want to be at the mercy of some hot startup that gets bought out and closes down, or fails and closes down and takes "my" data with them. I much prefer to have this data on servers I control and backed up for good.

I have been enjoying reading some of my old posts, they trigger memories (good and bad)

I also enjoy the act of writing again (after having written way too much in the last years, I had an almost physical aversion against writing - topic for another blog post one day...)

So - to the next 10 years.
