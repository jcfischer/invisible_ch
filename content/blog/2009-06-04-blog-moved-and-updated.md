We just moved this blog to our [own servers][1] and updated to Wordpress 2.7 in the process. While it seems that everything went smoothly, there sure are bound to be problems... I think that the Umlauts got messed during the move - but I'm not going to chase UTF-8 conversions....

Any other problems, missing stuff - let us know!
