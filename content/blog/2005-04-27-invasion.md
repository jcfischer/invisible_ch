I'm still sitting in the train from Bern to Zurich, in the business compartment (the one sporting electrical outlets). As usual there's a deluge of laptops (mostly Dell). But within 2 meters of me are two other 15" Apple Powerbooks.



That's the highest density I have witnessed in the last 8 months that I have travelled this route. Is the secret plan for world domination starting to work for his Steve-ness?
