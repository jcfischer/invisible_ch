Taking a cue from [Gadgetguy][1], I have burned the most requested feed by running it through [FeedBurner][2]. This will massage the feeds, making them easier accessible to people using a browser and various other nice things (like giving me statistics on who is reading this blog - similar to [Statcounter][3], who does an excellent job for tracking the web-usage of this blog.

Also it inserts links to "relevant" Amazon books. This of course in a constant effort to offset the cost of me running this blog. If it doesn't work out (as I suspect it will), this part will be removed again...
