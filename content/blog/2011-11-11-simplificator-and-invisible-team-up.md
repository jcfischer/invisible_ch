Today is a great day! I'm happy to announce that we are teaming up with our friends at [Simplificator GmbH](http://simplificator.com) and will be part of their team, as of today. Lukas, Pascal and I go back a long time - we have been through some "interesting" projects and learnt how to work with each other. In the process we got to know and respect each other and became friends. 

Now that our two companies have become one, we are a Rails development power-house in Zurich with plans to build great software and to extend the software development training that we have been doing over the last years.

InVisible has been around for a long long time (in Internet years) - in its current form since 2003. We are thrilled and happy to enter a new phase of development and are looking forward to many more exiting years, developing software and teaching software development.
