Finally the sun has come back into our world - the last few weeks have been way to gray for my taste. As you, gentle regular reader of this blog know, I am enrolled in the "[Introduction to Songwriting](https://www.coursera.org/course/songwriting)" course. This is one of the songs I have written as part of this course (and no, there is no recording yet that I am happy with)

    
    <code><strong>
    Gray Days</strong>
    
    <strong>Am                Em</strong>
    Around me seas of gray
    <strong>Am              Dm7</strong>
    am I loosing my will to live?
    <strong>Am                Em</strong>
    am I hunter, am I prey?
    <strong>Am                 F</strong>
    is there anything that I can give?
    
    Surrounded by gray masses
    am I loosing my touch in reality?
    Seeing lights and flashes
    Does this feel like normality?
    
    PreChorus
    <strong>   C                F</strong>
    No reflections, no lights,
    <strong>   C               Bdim</strong>
    no affections, no sights.
    
    Chorus
    <strong>Am         Am</strong>
    insecurity creeping up on me
    <strong>F               E7</strong>
    as if I haven't had enough
    <strong>Am        F                G</strong>
    all those people are obliv-ious
    <strong>Dm                Am</strong>
    to what I suffer through.
    <strong>Am          G         F             E7</strong>
    Gray days - even rain would make me feel better
    
    <strong>Am                            E</strong>
    Sun rays blasting through the gray
    <strong>Am                 D</strong>
    Is this helping my temperament?
    <strong>Am                           E</strong>
    Children outside starting to play
    <strong>Am                F</strong>
    There goes my bad sentiments
    
    reflections, lights,
    affections, sights
    
    insecurity dropping away from me
    I have had enough of it
    People around me are joyous
    And I feel totally fit
    Blues skies, blues skies - happiness and smiles
