The thing that pains me most about this conference, are the chairs. There are three different models in each of the halls, and they compete in the "which is the most uncomfortable" category.



There is no clear winner, all of them are extremely uncomfortable in the long run. They therefore can't be of danish design because danish design not only looks good, but serves their intended purposes. 



These chairs clearly don't.
