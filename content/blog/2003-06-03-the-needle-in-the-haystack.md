Over at the MIT, the researchers are looking for needles in the [Haystack](http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu/index.html). The blurb reads interesting:


<blockquote>_the universal information client_

Our research seeks to bring modern information management and retrieval technologies to the average computer user in order to make computers a more compelling place for users to interact with their information. Haystack looks into the use of artificial intelligence techniques for analyzing unstructured information and providing more accurate retrieval. We also deal with the modeling, management, and display of user data in more natural and useful ways.

There's a preview version - I'm still downloading it. I'll play with it later and see if I can find needles in my part of the haystack.
