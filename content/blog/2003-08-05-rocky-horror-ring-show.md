[vowe](http://vowe.net) how could you... bringing the [Rocky Horror Ring Show](http://ringwench.bravepages.com/rocky.html) to my attention...
I've seen the movie (several times), I've been in the theater, I've been to an open-air movie showing, dressed up in my wife-to-be's underwear (I had met her the night before and invited her to a night at the open-air movies, and - oh - could I have a look at her sexy underwear drawer please and help me to some of the stuff).
Also I've read the LOTR book (as a teen - in english) twice and I've seen the movie.

And now [this](http://ringwench.bravepages.com/rocky.html). I'm still drying the tears from lmao.
Thanks....
