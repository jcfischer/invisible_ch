Hmm - I guess it could be a lot worse than that - and the [Darwinian Poetry](https://www.codeasart.com/poetry/darwin.html) project has generated worse poetry.

I'm specifically interested in this kind of research, because my company [Ivorix - evolving software](https://www.ivorix.com/) builds software that relies on some of the same mechanisms to [generate trading strategies](https://www.ivorix.com/en/products/nsf/index.html) for trading stocks.

Out of the work, we've done, I know that genetic algorithms have to power to come up with solutions to really hard problems. Poetry seems to be one of these....
