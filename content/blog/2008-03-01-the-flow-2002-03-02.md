Not really getting much done at the moment, but busy nonetheless. Here's what crossed my newsreader:

try-ing made easy
-----------------

Did you ever write this in your Ruby or Rails code?

    person.name rescue ""

wouldn't it be nicer to try to to it easier?

    person.try(:name)

[Chris][1] thinks so too....

I improved on this (spectacularly) and now try supports fail:

    person.try(:name, :fail => "no person")

The extension is trivial:

    class Object
      def try(method, options = {})
        {:fail => nil }.merge(options)
        if respond_to? method 
          send(method)
        else
          options[:fail]
        end
      end
    end

Deploy to Heroku from Git
-------------------------

[Heroku][2] allows you to write Rails applications in the browser and deploy to EC2. Now they nice peoble of Heroku have released [Heroku API][3] that allows you to use Git. Now this looks even more interesting than before.

Rails Undo / Redo
-----------------

Do you want to implement Undo/Redo functionality into your Rails applications? Look no further: [RUR][4]
