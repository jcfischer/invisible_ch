My post on [augmentation](http://blog.invisible.ch/2013/02/23/75-augmentation/) a couple of days ago felt kind of unfinished. I couldn't really articulate how I feel about it - both very against and very excited about the possibilities of something like Google Glass.

Thankfully, there are smarter people out there, and [@zapgadget](https://twitter.com/zapgadget/status/307487141859033088) tweeted about this: [Mark Hurst has written a good piece on the implications of something like Glass](http://creativegood.com/blog/the-google-glass-feature-no-one-is-talking-about/) - not for the wearer, but for everybody else, not wearing it:


<blockquote>Google Glass is like one camera car for each of the thousands, possibly millions, of people who will wear the device – every single day, everywhere they go – on sidewalks, into restaurants, up elevators, around your office, into your home. From now on, **starting today,** anywhere you go within range of a Google Glass device, everything you do could be recorded and uploaded to Google’s cloud, and stored there for the rest of your life. You won’t know if you’re being recorded or not; and even if you do, you’ll have no way to stop it.

And _that_, my friends, is the experience that Google Glass creates. _That_ is the experience we should be thinking about. **The most important Google Glass experience is _not_ the user experience – it’s the experience of everyone else.** The experience of being a citizen, in public, is about to change.</blockquote>


In the comments section of his post, there is a link to a [post about a random guy filming other random people with a video camera](http://www.petapixel.com/2012/11/02/surveillance-camera-man-points-camera-at-strangers-without-permission/).

Creepy doesn't even begin to describe it...
