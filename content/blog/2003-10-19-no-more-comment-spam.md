I have had one too many comment spams now. I have implemented [James Seng's MT plugin](https://james.seng.cc/archives/000145.html)  that displays an image with some numbers that you have to type in the box below. Only humans are supposed to be able to do this ;-)

On a side note: On a Redhat 7.3 system, you need to get the current version of [GD](https://www.boutell.com/gd/) before using the perl GD module that you get through CPAN... I spent quite a bit of time tracking that down... thanks to a [FAQ on GraphDefang](https://www.bl.org/~jpk/graphdefang/faq.html) for pointing me in the right direction.
