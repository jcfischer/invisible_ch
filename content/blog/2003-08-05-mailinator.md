Need an email adress - NOW? enter : "whatever@mailinator.com" then head over to [Mailinator.com](http://www.mailinator.com/) and pick up the information you need.

Perfect for those sign-up services that you will be using only once. And the best thing - mailinator needs no sign-up. Just by sending an email to that adress, creates the mailbox.
