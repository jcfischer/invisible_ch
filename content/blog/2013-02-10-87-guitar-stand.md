To all of you who wondered what the [day of woodcarving](http://blog.invisible.ch/2013/02/09/88-woodcarving/)Â produced:

A guitar stand for my Telecaster and the Norman acoustic.

As you can see from the detail shot, I made a mistake in the geometry of the stand. The back is angled, so the lower support should have been angled too. There's also a cut visible, but this one I left in deliberately. It is my rendition of [Wabi Sabi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi). This is my first piece of wood cutting and I'm more than happy to show that (both the roughness of the whole piece and the imperfections that are due to my clumsiness)
