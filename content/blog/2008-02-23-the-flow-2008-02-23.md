Opera Kestrel Mac Blog
----------------------

Opera used to be my favourite Web browser. That is until they started Kestrel (9.5) alphas. A lot of crashing... The advent of the new [Opera Mac Blog][1] also marks a new release... I have been using Firefox 3.0 beta 3 for some time now and actually have started to like it (unlike the old versions, that I generally hate)

Family

My father would have turned 98 today. Happy birthday. Tobias cried in your memory yesterday.
