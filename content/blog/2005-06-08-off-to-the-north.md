I'll be leaving for [reboot7](http://reboot.dk/reboot7/show/HomePage) tomorrow morning.



I'm looking forward both to return to the city where I lived for 4 years as a kid, to visit my grandmother (who is very sick unfortunately) and to see/talk/listen/discuss with the [luminaries](http://reboot.dk/reboot7/show/Participants) that are going to be there.



Of course, I will try to get [one of the things](http://www.43things.com/things/view/7920) of my 43things off the list too. [This one](http://www.43things.com/things/view/14932) will take care of itself ;-)
