As I have nothing really to say today, I will use this space to make a meta tweet.

I already have made it one third through the [100 day blog challenge](/2013/01/28/100-days/). Some days it was easier, some days more difficult - especially when being tired. But all in all, its a lot less work than I thought it would be. Hopefully you, dear reader, have found one or two posts that have brought you something...
