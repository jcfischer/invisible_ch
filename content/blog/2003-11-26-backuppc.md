I have been thinking about how to reliable backup my different computers and laptops. One solution that I favoured was to use [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org) to synd all my stuff to a central server (and use rsync again to sync the backup sets between two servers on different locations).

I thought about a neat frontend for, that would allow me to select the directories that would be backuped and a webfrontend for restore.

It turns out that (of course, I might say) somebody already has done this...

I'll be installing [BackupPC](http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/) soon and see if it indeed does what it should. Browsing the site, it seems to do it all and a bit more!
