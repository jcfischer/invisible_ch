It's great to see how popular my website has become. And of course I received about 60 comment spams while I was on holiday. Deleting them manually using GPRS was slow and will cost me a fortune.

Now I have implemented the [MT-Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/) by [Jay Allen](http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/).

Hopefully this time, comment spam will be a thing of the past....
