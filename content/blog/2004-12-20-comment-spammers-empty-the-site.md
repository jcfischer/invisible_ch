You might - if you have come here through the normal web address - have wondered why the site was empty, except for a lot of links.

Well, I have had a lot of comment-spam and while it generally was easy to get rid of it, it has rebuilt the site. And I have specified that only the last couple of days of entries are displayed. So - after each rebuild, more content was removed.

This post, therefore, serves no other means then generating some content, so that there again is something to look at, on the front page.

How pathetic is that?
