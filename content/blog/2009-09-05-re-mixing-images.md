One of the assignments I have to write for the Masters Programme I'm working on now, had me thinking about re-mixing. I had written about the presentation by [Cornelia Sollfrank](http://www.artwarez.org/) at [Tweakfest a couple of years ago on this blog](/2005/11/10/tweakfest-net-art-generation/). It prompted me to use the net.art generator to create the following image:

[caption id="attachment_750" align="alignright" width="480" caption="The net.art generator asked to generate an image for \"citation\", \"academia\" and \"cultural\""][![The net.art generator asked to generate an image for "citation", "academia" and "cultural"](/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/renoir-citation_academia_cultural.png)](http://nag.iap.de/?ac=create&name=renoir&query=citation+academia+cultural&comp=4&width=600&ext=jpg)[/caption]

Quite fitting :)
