One project I'm working on has me working with different databases and Java objects. I needed some pointers on design and was given this incredible great link: [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321127420/104-9858283-2273501) by [Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com), the guy who brought me into the ExtremeProgramming world via his book Refactoring.
