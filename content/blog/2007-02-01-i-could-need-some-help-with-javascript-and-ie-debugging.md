I'm working on an AJAXy application that works just fine and dandy with Safari, Firefox and Opera. And it works so so on IE6 and IE7. I have tried to come to grips with IE and script debugging but given up in disgust. Is there anyone out there that

a) understand Javascript
b) has a script debugger environment setup for IE6 or IE7 (I guess that fixing the bug for one browser fixes it for the second one as well) 
c) has about 10 minutes of time to diagnose the problem

If you are that person, please contact me at [jcf@invisible.ch](mailto:jcf@invisible.ch) for details
