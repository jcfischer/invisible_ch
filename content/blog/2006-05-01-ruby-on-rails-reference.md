Tomorrow marks the start of my third Ruby On Rails course. It's going to be a 3 day course with a (somewhat lengthy) introduction to Ruby (and some of the joys of programming in a very dynamic language) with the rest of the time devoted to Rails. I firmly believe in hands-on training, so the amount of lecturing is minimal. And there are only 5 or 6 participants in the class. They will build an application from scratch - either something from their domain (or if they don't have any idea) an application that I have thought out.

The course materials consist of the two books "Programming Ruby" and "Agile Web Development with Rails". In addition, I created a 20+ page summary of the most used Rails commands, functions, classes. It's based partly on the book and mostly on the source code and it's documentation. Consider it a giant "cheat sheet" for rails. 

I release it under a [Creative Commons][1] license.

There's the PDF version [rails-reference-1.1.pdf][2] (480 kb) and the [HTML version][5] and you can check out the source code (it's all written in plain text [Markdown][3]) in the [Subversion repository][4]. The [Changelog][7] will tell you what has changed.

Comments, feedback, corrections are welcome! Oh - and if you like it, feel free to [Digg it][6] 

The guide will always be free, but if you'd like, you can buy me a beer by pressing the nice PayPal Donation button here:
