...until [reboot 8][1] starts. I just saw the [detailed program][2] and I'm feeling like a kid in a toy store. So much to see, so much to hear, so much to learn...

Until I'm flying for Denmark however, there's a few things to get done:

* install a new version of one of the rails projects I'm working on
* Watch the soccer match between the current [world champion Brasil and FC Luzern][3] on TV with my son
* Meet a potential new Rails client
* Work at an existing client (replacing the [RoboSource Control][4] system they use for RoboHelp with Subversion)
* Answer a bunch of questions from other clients
* See the [Jon bon Jovi concert in Bern][5]
* get some sleep
* pack
