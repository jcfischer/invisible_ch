A new web site, that we developed launched today: [ZermattSoundz.ch](https://zermattsoundz.ch), the companion site to Europe's highest open-air concert, April 18/19. It features [Eisblume](https://www.eisblume.de/), [Ich + Ich](https://www.ich-und-ich.de/), [Materia](https://www.myspace.com/marteria) and [Die Fantastischen 4](https://www.diefantastischenvier.de/).

It was designed by our partners [CrÃ©ation](https://creation.ch) and developed with [Radiant](https://radiantcms.org) on Ruby on Rails. 

Well done, team!
