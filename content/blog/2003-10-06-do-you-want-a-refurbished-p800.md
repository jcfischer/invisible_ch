Well - you know [what happened to my P800](https://www.invisible.ch/archives/000184.html). While it was getting repaired (actually it got a new screen and parts of a new case) I lived with my old R520 and the Tungsten T3 came out.

I broke down and now have the T3 - and in combination with my R520 it beats the P800 in almost every discipline. 

  * it's fast, really fast
  * The screen is gorgeous
  * Dialing a phone number is at least 3 times faster with the combination T3 -> R520 -> HBH-15 (bluetooth headset) than with the P800
  * It runs [HourzPro](https://www.zoskware.com) and [LifeBalance](https://www.llamagraphics.com) - two programs I can't live without

Do you want a refurbished [P800 on ebay](https://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=45766&item=3353411715)?
