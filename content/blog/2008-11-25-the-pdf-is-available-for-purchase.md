It took a long time, but the publisher of my book and my company finally agreed on a method of selling the PDF of my Rails book not only on CD (and only to people in germany) but - as it should be - as a downloadable version.

I have setup a small shop at http://rails-praxis.myshopify.com/ with a standard Shopify template and using [Fetch.app](http://www.fetchapp.com/) to handle the digital downloads.

This is a temporay solution until the [publisher](http://www.mitp.de) can handle digital downloads (which means, that it will be in place for quite some time I guess)... 

So with that: if you enjoyed the book, go out and buy the PDF and show my publisher, that indeed, there is a market for digital, non-DRM, PDFs and that readers are willing to pay for the advantages of digital.
