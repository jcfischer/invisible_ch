Just a quick shout out to [Hibiki-An](http://www.hibiki-an.com/), a japanese green tea producer, that has a good website, a good selection of great green teas and assorted accessoires and excellent and quick shipping. [Alain](http://blog.dispatched.ch/) and I ordered some tea, two [Kyusu](http://www.hibiki-an.com/product_info.php/cPath/23/products_id/440), matcha bowls last  thursday and the nice postman delivered the package yesterday. 5 days for a delivery from Japan is fantastic. Also, with an order value of more than USD 150, the company pays for international express shipping.

The tea is really really  good, and in the end, half as expensive as if I had bought it here locally in Zurich. Globalisation is a good thing, isn't it?
