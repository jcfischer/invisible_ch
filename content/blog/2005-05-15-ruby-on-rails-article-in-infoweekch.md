Last week my article on [Ruby on Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.com/) came out in [Infoweek.ch](https://www.infoweek.ch/). It briefly describes Rails, Ruby and gives a very high-level overview over the development and the advantages of Rails over other development frameworks.

Thanks to the guys at Infoweek, I'm allowed to give you a PDF version of the article. Enjoy (and beware: it's in german):

**UPDATE:Â **




The PDF has disappeared from my server, but the original article is still available [online](https://www.itmagazine.ch/Artikel/Seite/21191/2/Applikationsentwicklung_im_Schnellzugsverfahren.html).
