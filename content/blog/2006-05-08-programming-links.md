There's so much to do and so little time, so I leave you with a few links to recently discovered gems:

 * [We Tried Baseball and It Didn't Work][1] -- a look at extreme - ahh - batting by Ron Jeffries?
 * [Start-Up lessons][2] -- as always excellent reading by Paul Graham
 * [observe OS X filesystem events][3] -- looks useful
 * [Signs you are a bad programmer][4] -- I plead guilty to having had some of those attributes
