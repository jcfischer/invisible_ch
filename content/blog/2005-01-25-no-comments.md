The comments on this blog are turned off, due to [various][1] [major][2] problems with the comment script sending out spam. I'm not sure if my vintage MoveableType installation has a problem, but I want to play this safe. Also, I don't have time for redoing all the layouts at the momen, so I have just renamed the mt-comments.cgi script and removed the executable bit.

You'll see 404's if you click on Comments or if you try to post one.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
