"I can sleep when I'm dead" and "sleep is overrated"

Those were things a younger me said one in a while. Not anymore. If I find myself at the end of an all-nighter (those have happened lately), I'm toast the next day (at least).

And now something else has come up, the last few days I have slept incredibly bad: waking up in the middle of night, heart pounding, feeling driven. Often accompanied by weird dreams or nightmares. (Tonight I first finished my song outline for the first assignment in the [Coursera Songwriting class](https://www.coursera.org/course/songwriting) - sadly I can't remember it, and then went on a killing spree with bow and arrow in a 100 vs 5 scenario in some medieval setting)

I'm not sure why this is, and why I have had those problems the last few nights. At first I thought it was too much green tea late at night, or a cat that had slept on my pillow (our cats are not allowed in the bed room), but I'm not 100% sure.

I have already ruled out the tea, now tonight I will try to rule out wine and tomorrow the cat. As a scientist, I can't just change two variables at the same time, so fresh bed sheets and no wine is a no-no.

Wish me luck (and a good nights sleep - I desperately need it)
