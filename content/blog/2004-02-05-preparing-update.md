The server you are hitting is about to undergo some major surgery. First of all, it will get a [3Ware 2 Port RAID Adapter](http://www.3ware.com/products/parallel_ata.asp) together with 2 Samsung SpinPoint 160 GB disks, serving in a RAID 1 configuration.

Next, the aging Red-Hat 7.3 system will be updated to a Debian Woody Stable release. I have googled around, and there are a number of "How-To's" - [Emma's one](http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2004/debian-user-200401/msg02972.html) has links to installation notes, HOW-TO's and the works.

This means that, this machine will be down sometime during the next few days - depending mainly on the arrival of the RAID controller.
