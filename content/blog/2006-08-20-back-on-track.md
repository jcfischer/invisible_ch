The good news first:

* I'm back from a week of vacation in Copenhagen where I had a chance to visit my 87 year old grandmother (who is in great shape), meet [Henriette][1] and her lovely family, show Copenhagen to my family. We were stopped in our travels by a lunch-box-mistaken-for-a-bomb on a train station, by a piece of left luggage on the airport and the going missing of a train-driver. All in all a really nice week
* [My back's back in shape][2] - I have started the regularly scheduled fitness training again
* There's a lot of work waiting to be done - both for clients and I have one or two ideas of my own. I'll probably only be able to manage the clients projects though - too bad
* We have two new members in our house: Lucy and Kitty are sibling cats, just 12 weeks old and oh-so-cute. I have allergies against cat's, but have been taking [Schwarzkummelol / Albaracka Oil][3] capsules for the last 3 months and I hardly feel any reaction to the cats (we've had the mother of the two cats as a frequent guest the last few weeks. Here's hoping that this really helps against the allergies. Oh - and be warned - there might be cat content on this blog in the future.
* [Florian][4] is doing much better and has been transfered to a rehabilitation clinic

Bad news:

* The bad weather in Denmark killed my Lumix LX-1. I'll have to see if a repair is affordable at a reasonable price or if it's time for a new camera
