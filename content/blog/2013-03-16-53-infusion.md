I have had a blast today, working on my "Introduction to Music Production" assignment and had planned to write something about the learning process.

However, I am drinking "infusion" (rose hip tea with lemon). Anybody knowing me will know that I tend to drink real tea ([Camellia sinensis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis)). This can only mean one thing: I'm starting to get sick.

No elaboration on learning today, but here's the video I made 
[Comping Audio Tracks with Reaper](http://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=plcp&v=jpnzjy8mcIw)
