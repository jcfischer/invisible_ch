After almost a year with an Ipaq3870, I've dusted off my old Visor Deluxe and reinstalled from a backup. Synched with Outlook to get back my calendar and adresses and I'm back in business. Two programs that I have missed so much during the PocketPC days: 

[Lifebalance](https://www.llamagraphics.com)
[HourzPro ](https://www.zoskware.com)

Nothing on the PocketPC comes even close... 
I'll still use my Ipag in the car, using the very nice [GPS Navigation Software](https://www.navigon.de)  I have. 

Wonder why I don't use my CompaqIpaq any more?  Read on:
<!-- more -->
The IPaq: It looks great, has lot's of memory, fantastic color display, bluetooth built in - and much much more. 

But: 





  * I have to reset it once a day 

  * it feels slower than my old HandspringVisor? 

  * Every little developer thinks it's OK to charge US$ 20 for a stupid "freeware" style program 

  * I am so much faster looking up and entering day to day stuff on my Visor - it's just not funny 

  * Have I mentionend LifeBalance and HourzPro? Nothing that even comes close on the PocketPC platform 



Oh - before you ask: I will keep my Ipaq. It makes a great GPS Navigation system
