It's getting better all the time...


  * RSS Reader
  * New GUI
  * self learning categorisation of mail
  * IRC client
  * lot of bug fixes
  * lot of new bugs

I like it so far.. Sure it has a couple of warts, but knowing how those [guys in Norway](http://www.opera.com/) work, Opera 7.50 wil mature fast. I just wondered, when the last feature upgrade for IE came out - 2 years ago? Thank god there are alternatives...
