Damn - David & the assorted crew are so fast. I have the [development timeline][1] of [RubyOnRails][2] in my [Bloglines][3] and it's almost always the feed with the most new entries. Now [Rails 0.9.4][5] has been released and there's a lot of stuff, that again will make my life easier.

Mange Tak, David!

Working with Rails has been an incredible ride, I have learnt a bunch and I'm getting closer and closer to actually deploy and use [Amuda][4] for real. Developing in Rails is refreshing simple. Many times, one single line of code does what in Java would have taken dozens.

This is real productivity, right there.
