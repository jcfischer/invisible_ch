Today my [companies](http://www.invisible.ch/) new blog: [not.invisible.ch](http://not.invisible.ch/) goes live. This blog will focus on the what our company is doing. A "behind the scenes" look if you will. We have heard the jokes about our companies name. While we consider ourselves successful if what we have done becomes "invisible", the process, the thought, the work we are doing is not. The not.invisible.ch blog's task in life is to make that process visible.



I hope to gently persuade my partner and our employees to blog too - we'll see how that goes.



And it gives me the opportunity to play with a new blogging system: [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com/) (which is written in [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/))
