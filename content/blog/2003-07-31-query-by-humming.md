An intersting audio application: [Query By Humming](https://cebit2003.fraunhofer.de/servlet/is/4107/) from the inventor of the MP3 format allows you to hum a fragment of a tune and the computer tells you the name of the song.

Test it at [Musicline](https://www.musicline.de/de/melodiesuche) (server seems to be down)
