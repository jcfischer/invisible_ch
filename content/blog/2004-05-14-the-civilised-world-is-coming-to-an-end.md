And it's the same old song that has been played for centuries. The civilised world is going down.

No -- I'm not talking about the torturing in Iraq. Not about the boneheadedness of some of our politicians. It's not about Six Aparts [controversial](http://vowe.net/archives/004521.html) new [licensing scheme](http://secure.sixapart.com/) for Movable Type (me? I'm planning my move to [Textpattern](http://www.textpattern.com/))

I'm talking about [GÃ¼nther](http://wm.warnermusic.com/Sweden/Svenskt/gunther_dingdongsong_hi.wmv).  [ link via [vowe](http://vowe.net/archives/004519.html) ]

It seems that the music industry sees it fit to produce garbage like the one I linked to (and I urge you to click on the link, so that the bandwidth bill of the Warner Music explodes). This is what they have money for. On the other hand, the music industry (and of course also Warner)  [cuts jobs left and right](http://www.ftd.de/tm/me/1077951800761.html?nv=rs), stops production and distribution of local music and sues people that are listening to "real" music.

One more reason to [boycott the music industry](/archives/000260.html).
