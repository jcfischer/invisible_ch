No [mention of .txt files](/archives/000315.html) could go without the mention that [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) is my favorite editor.

[Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/) gives us a [glimpse into his .emacs](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/12/30/UcontrolLove) and there are a number of things that I will try out to see if they fit my style of working.
