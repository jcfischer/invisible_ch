Yesterdays rails-konferenz.de was quite a success. Almost 100 particpants showed up for a one day, information packed day. 

My presentation on "Extreme Testing" went very well. The slides should be up in a couple of days on the [rails-konferenz.de][1] web site. 

I had a chance to reconnect to people I met at [other][2] [conferences][3] and make quite a few new acquaintances. The personal hightlights for me were a comment about Capistrano in the Q&A section of the Capistrano talk by Ralf Wirdemann  (which  will allow me to use Capistrano on a server that doesn't allow access to the SVN repository), Patrick Lenz's take on Rails scalability and of course Rany Kedos plan for getting out of a boring job (not that I would need that, thankfully):

1. Deceive
2. Lie
3. Steal

All in all a great day, and I'm looking forward to the next installation.
