I confess - I have a fetish (well actually, a couple of them, but I'm only going to talk about one that is for public consumption).

I am into keyboards. Computer keyboards. I don't know when it started, but I was always fascinated with keyboards. I learnt touch typing at the tender age of 12 (going to a course and possibly being the youngest in that school to learn to type).

I couldn't really use my new skills on the first computers I had (the [Sharp PC-1211](https://pocket.free.fr/html/sharp/pc-1211_e.html), the [Oric 1](https://www.digidome.nl/orichall.htm) ([review](https://www.gondolin.org.uk/hchof/reviews/text/yc-oric-1.html)), a [Sinclair](https://www.digidome.nl/sinclair.htm) ZX81 and Spectrum (and almost a QL). The [Commodere](https://www.digidome.nl/commodor.htm) PET (at school) and the 64 (at home) where the first with somthing like a real keyboard. And finally the [Atari Portfolio (my first PDA)](https://www.digidome.nl/atari.htm) and Atari ST made me work in computers.

And then there were the PC's. With external keyboards. I remember some cheap plastic stuff and then I bought my first real keyboard, a [Cherry Ergo Plus](https://www.tifaq.com/keyboards/historical-keyboards.html#kb-ergoplus) which I loved and took with me to work. Then I managed to salvage an original IBM keyboard - which has served me for many years now. 

For my PDA's I got a [Stowaway](https://www.thinkoutside.com/products/palm-oview2.html) and recently a [Palm Wireless Keyboard](https://store.palmone.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1387252)

So when I saw the [Logitech DiNovo Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?page=products/details&CRID=486&CONTENTID=7321&ad=lgpr7905_emea_dinovo_502003) I was very interested. I then had the opportunity to play with it a bit - and it's feel is quite OK. It's not the best keyboard I've ever typed on (the Cherry must be the one I liked most in terms of feel) but it feels like a good Laptop keyboard. And it has no wires. And it acts as a bluetooth hub for my Palm and my T610. 

I have one since yesterday and so far like it quite a bit. It worked without installation (keyboard / mouse). The software that can be installed looks interesting, but I doubt I use much of the keyboard shortcut functions. Let me type a couple of 100 pages and I'll let you know how good it really is.
