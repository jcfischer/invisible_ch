Back in the old days[1], I worked at a company that imported [Mac Emulators for the Atari ST](http://www.stcarchiv.de/stc1987/02_macemus.php3) and sold them. We had all kind of fun stuff to deal with, the most notorious being to find old Mac ROMs for the emulators.

Anyway - today, it's easier: Use the [Web Based Mac SE](http://myoldmac.net/webse-e.htm) without a ROM ...

[1] and with old, I mean OLD -- I just tried to find references on the web to the company, but it's difficult... The company was called Trillian, and googling for Trillian is a bad idea (if you're looking for that specific old, Atari ST distribution company. Searching for Marvin (which was one of the related companies yields a bit better results, and if you actually happen to know the name of some of the products that Marvin developed and Trillian distributed you will find one or two references ;-) 

Oh - and I even found a [review of the colibri scanner](http://www.stcarchiv.de/stm89/10_colibri.php3)
