The sunday house cleaning saw my wife working on the kitchen while I was in the roof, re-purposing old and new electronics to create a more permanent home studio.

1 2008 MacPro (now that it is not powerful enough to compute BitCoins anymore)
1 22" Monitor
1 old Ikea Desk
1 [Sonos ZP100 with speakers](https://www.sonos.com/documents/productguides/en/Zoneplayer100_EN.pdf) (instead of monitor speakers)
1 Logitech Mouse
1 M-Audio Fast Track
1 [Yeti USB Microphone](https://bluemic.com/yeti/)
1 [1996 Fender Telecaster](https://www.fender.com/en-CH/series/american-standard/american-standard-telecaster/)
1 [Norman B18
](https://www.normanguitars.com/b18tobacco.html)1 Ibanez Combo Amp
1 [Bose ME-70
1](https://www.bossus.com/gear/productdetails.php?ProductId=1001) [ADA MP-1 Tube PreAmp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbWdk2nmlak) (No, I don't play nowhere near as good as this guy)
1 [Roland A300 Pro
](https://www.roland.com/products/en/A-300PRO/)[Reaper DAW](https://reaper.fm)
u-he [Zebra](https://www.u-he.com/cms/zebra) and [Diva](https://www.u-he.com/cms/diva) (love those analogue sounds)

Still a few pieces missing (need some dynamic mics and mic stands next), but already good enough to make some noise.
