[Software Principles](http://www.google.com/corporate/software_principles.html) by Google:


  1. We believe software should not trick you into installing it.
  2. When an application is installed or enabled, it should inform you of its principal and significant functions.
  3. It should be easy for you to figure out how to disable or delete an application.
  4. If an application collects or transmits your personal information such as your address, you should know.
  5. Application providers should not allow their products to be bundled with applications that do not meet these guidelines.


Oh yes! This is something that I will sign immediately. These are good rules, and it's interesting to see that Google is not only saying "we're not evil", but saying it in different tongues.

Of course, that doesn't mean, that you should trust both your GMail and your mailing lists to Google (there are alternatives and there [will be more](http://www.zappatanetworks.com))
