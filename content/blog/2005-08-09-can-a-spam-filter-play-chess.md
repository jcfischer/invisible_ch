A really interesting question. Can a [Spam Filter][1] play [a game of chess][2]? [Matthias][3] might be interested to try this at his job ;-)

The tale of the spam filter that learns to play chess is very interesting. It shows, that seemingly [simple algorithms][4] can [produce interesting results][5].
