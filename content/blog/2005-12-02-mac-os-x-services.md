R. had told me about this strange "Services" menu in OS X, but I never really bothered to look deeper into it. The article "[Mac OS X Services (the menu you never go to)](https://highschoolblows.blogspot.com/2005/11/mac-os-x-services-menu-you-never-go-to.html)" told me a bit more about the things possible, when text is selected...




  * Let my Mac read some text loud


  * Open the selected text in an editor


  * Call someone on Skype when their name is selected


  * Open the selected text in a web browser


  * Blog the text


  * summarize the text


  * ...




Many programs install additional services ([Ecto](https://ecto.kung-foo.tv/), [Skype](https://www.skype.com/), [TextMate](https://www.macromates.com/), [Emacs](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Quicksilver](https://quicksilver.blacktree.com/)) and there are more services on the internet (for example at [DEVONtechnologies](https://www.devon-technologies.com/products/freeware/services.php)) where the great TextServices comes from.



Makes the Mac even more useful
