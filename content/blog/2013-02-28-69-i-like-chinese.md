With many greetings to our Chinese intern, Chengchen, who spent the last couple of days at our house and was a wonderful guest. Totally amazing guy - he came to complete his studies in CS at the university of Montpelier, France, 3 years ago - without then speaking a word of french. Now he comes to Zurich from spring to summer and he has already learnt the correct pronunciation of Grüezi, something most Germans can't handle after having lived here for several years.

I introduced him to Ruby and Rails yesterday and today, and he seemed to totally get it - will be interesting to see, how fast he can contribute to the Mobino code base - I'm convinced that it will be rather sooner than later...
