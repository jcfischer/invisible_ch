I have started a new Rails project for a colleague of mine. Time to live on the [(rails)edge][1] again for this project.

As usual, it's fun to get into the freshly developed mode again, after having finished two large Rails projects. The feeling of building something out of nothing is great. 

And of course I'm taking the opportunity to update my [Rails Reference][2] to Rails 1.2

Is there anything in particular you'd like to see covered in the next release of the reference? Let me know!
