I was visiting Benno, my friend who got both a PowerBook for himself and an iBook for his wife. When I looked at his running applications, I noticed "Norton Antivirus for Mac" running on his computer.



I laughed and said, that he wouldn't need it. To this he answered, that there were indeed viriii for the Mac. I challenged him to name one. He [googled](http://www.google.com/search?q=virus+mac+os+x&sourceid=opera&num=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) and the very first entry said "Why there are no viruses for the Mac".



A couple of minutes later I read "[Move along, nothing to see here](http://vowe.net/archives/005826.html)" at vowe's flying circus.



He then proceeded to deinstall the whole Norton crap (which took an ungodly amount of time and several reboots).



Living without fear is a great feeling!
