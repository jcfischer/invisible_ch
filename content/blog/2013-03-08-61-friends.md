It has been a long time since I was out in a bar with a friend, talking for 3 hours over a couple of beers.

Walking home, I realized how much I have missed this.

Thank you, friend, for your stories, your insights, your listening, your advice, your cheers.

Hopefully, it wont't take that long until the next time.
