One of the first programming environments I worked with was the [6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) CPU and its assembler. I liked it quite a bit better than the [Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z80)Â (which didn't hinder me of course to ask for a Z80 programming book as a birthday gift - my parents surely thought I was crazy)

I never, really really, grasped assembler then (although later, one of my first big software projects was to write the [DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard) encryption for [8051](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8051). The only source I found for DES was an obscure paper that described the algorithm in [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)). I learned to read APL, and started to implement the algorithm in assembler. Of course there was no good tooling available, so I wrote a 8051 Assembler in Turbo Pascal. And while I was at it, I also wrote a 8051 emulator in Turbo Pascal. I vaguely remember if...then...elsif... elsif... end constructions that spanned several 100 lines of code in the inner loop of the emulator - at that time I hadn't yet heard of lookup tables.)

But back to the 6502. A couple of years ago, the [Visual 6502](https://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/) implemented the actual gates of the processore in JavaScript, and today I stumbled upon the [Easy 6502](https://skilldrick.github.com/easy6502/) introduction to its assembly language (with a high level simulator in JavaScript). (Link via [Infovore](https://infovore.org/archives/2013/02/06/links-for-february-5th-5/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+infovoredotorg+%28Infovore%29))

Fond memories, some of the stuff actually came back to me from the hazy mists of my memory.

And boy - am I glad, that there are high level languages these days!
