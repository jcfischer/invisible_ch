My friend and partner in crime (rather InVisible) [Keith Bingman](http://keithbingman.com/) is leaving Europe tomorrow morning.

I met Keith at Reboot 7 (or 8) in Copenhagen. We met again a year later and talked about working for me. Soon after, he started to work for my then company InVisible, and became a major asset due to this many skills. He turned into a CSS and JavaScript wizard very fast, and helped develop a number of great web projects.

Keith made the transfer with me to [Simplificator](http://simplificator.com) late 2011 and continued to do great work.

He has [accepted a new challenge](http://www.mobify.com/) in Vancouver.

Godspeed Keith - I will miss you. So long, and thanks for all the good times!
