I have been using [ZoÃ«](https://guests.evectors.it/zoe/) for a while now (as a kind of Google for Email) and I'm more than happy with it. Recently RaphaÃ«l included the possibility that ZoÃ« also handles RSS feeds like email. When using this feature with this Blog, I noticed that the RSS entries that come from this site are truncated to 15 characters or so - not really much meat for an indexing engine. Thanks to [Andrew Dunn](https://www.aedunn.com) my blog now outputs both RSS1.0 and 2.0 feeds with the full text of an entry - just like it should be. Get his [instructions](https://www.aedunn.com/blog/mtrssfeed.txt) and implement them!
