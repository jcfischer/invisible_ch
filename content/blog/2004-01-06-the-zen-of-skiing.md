<blockquote>Sometimes you don't fight the skis. You don't fight the weather. You don't fight the mountain.

In rare circumstances, your body flows down the mountain in fluid motion. You don't have to think about the at of skiing. Your body just does it. You become part of the mountain.

Excellent.</blockquote>



All in all I achieved this state for a total of about 2 minutes during the holidays. It was worth it.

Of course it was also worth for the fact, that my little girl (4 years) got the hang of skiing and I can take her most of the places now. Gone are the days of standing around, freezing or pulling a sleigh while the bigger one cries for more action on the slope. YEAH!
