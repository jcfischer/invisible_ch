The lack of updates here are due to a variety of reasons:

 * having my wife in hospital to have her gall bladder removed
 * having one of our rabbits disappear (either as part of a stroll in the wild or becoming a valuable member of the food chain - valuable for a fox, that is. Probably both, because we didn't see any signs of a fight in the cage)
 * Starting construction of a new, bigger, better, bolder cage for the remaining rabbit (and it's two new friends, that are waiting to become a part of our family)
 * The delivery of a 15 page project description for my education to become an [Organisator][1] (business analyst)
 * The finishing touches to two rails projects (I still continue to provide those touches)
 * The usual mid-year release of 2 Notes projects I handle
 * The continuing writing of the (successful beyond my wildest dreams) [Ruby on Rails Reference][2] (Now including both a TOC and a section on ActionMailer)
 * spending 2 days a week as the liaison between Notes admins and Notes developers at a large Notes customer (and responsible for maintaining the import process from a host system to the NAB that controls access rights for 20'000 users)
 * Preparing for [reboot][3] (if you are a OpenBC member, please join the [reboot group][4] (via [Martin Roll][5])
 * Fighting chronic back pain (due to some inflamed muscles in my lower back)
 * setting up my wife's new [MacBook][6] (what a gorgeous little machine)
 * I'm sure there's more...
