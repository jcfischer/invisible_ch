When I write documentation I use DocBook to write structured text. DocBook is either in SGML or XML and can be - shall we say - interesting - to write in Emacs, my tool of choice for text processing.
Enter [XXE](https://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/index.html) by french company [XML Mind](https://www.xmlmind.com/). XXE is written in Java, does WYSIWIG editing of DocBook (or other XML schemata), uses CSS to format things on screen, can convert to HTML, RTF and PDF. It's extremely fast, very full featured and generally a joy to use.
If you need to write DocBook - go and check it out.
Oh - the standard version is free too - and has a very liberal license for use. And XMLMind just released version 2.4
