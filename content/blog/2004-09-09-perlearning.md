I have to do some things on a Sun Solaris box where the only scripting languages available are sh and perl. No python, no ruby, no ... well you get the point.

I don't like PERL a lot, even though the [monks](http://www.perlmonks.org/) are chanting it's praise. Granted, it can do amazing stuff, but then a horde of monkeys typing away on their keyboard would probably sooner come up with a syntactically valid PERL program, than with a Shakespeare sonnet or even a simple haiku.

Anyway: If there's nothing else available, PERL is still better than sh. So I'm biting the bullet and coding in PERL - and amazingly enough, mostly the stuff works. But it can be done better - here's a series of articles that help beginners like me change our ways of programming:
