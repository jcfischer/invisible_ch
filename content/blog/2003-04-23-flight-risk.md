[Wired News](https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58754,00.html) does a good job of recapping the events so far, and the author of the blog "Isabella" stopped by [Collective Detective's discussion](https://www.collectivedetective.org/campaign/lounge/discussion/849) (free reg. req'd) and candidly answered many skeptics questions.
