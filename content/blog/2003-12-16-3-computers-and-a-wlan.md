from the "it-just-works" dept:

three people, three computers, three operating systems - one new WLAN access point in my office.

Installing the access point (D-Link AP2000) and finding the DHCP setting for it's IP adress: 5 minutes (D-Link could use some help designing the web interface for their access point... Good: You have to change the default admin password to use it)



  * Mac OS/X: online without intervention
  * Windows XP: online with one manual intervention (select to connect to insecure WLAN)
  * Linux: online with severe manual intervention (and writing obscure stuff in some configuration files)


All in all - a really enjoyable experience...

And - it does tell you something about [ZAPPATA](https://www.zappatanetworks.com/) [Personal Groupware](https://www.zappatanetworks.com/)
