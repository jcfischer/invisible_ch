I have salvaged a Dell PowerEdge 1400 SC with dual P3 / 800 MHz CPUs. It is going to serve as my home file server (with a 3Ware RAID Controller and 480 GB of RAID 5 disks).

So far, it has booted with a [Knoppix](https://www.knoppix.org) CD, so I know that it will work (eventually).

Here are the links, that will hopefully help me get this beast (god - it is loud - that will be a problem for the WAF) up and running.
