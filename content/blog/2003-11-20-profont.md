Catching up on my reading of [Joel](http://joelonsoftware.com/index.html) pointed me to [ProFont](http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/), a rendition of the Mac 9 point font for Windows, Mac and Linux. I'm a sucker for big screens with small content, so I downloaded it and I'm using it on the 1600x1200 display. People will cry that it's too small, but I'm the one in front of the computer all day, and I wear glasses - so don't bother me about that ;-)

Oh - and it works in Lotus Notes and IntelliJ IDEA (the TrueType version though)
