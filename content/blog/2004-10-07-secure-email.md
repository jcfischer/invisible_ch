R. stumbled upon [Jeftel](http://www.jeftel.com/jeftel/Home/Home2.cfm) that promises (among other things) an end to Spam. They do it by using a proprietary, peer-2-peer email system. That's great news actually, beacuse it shows us, that we haven't been the only ones having this idea. (And as Simon Garfinkel notes, [P2P comes clean](http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/04/10/wo_garfinkel100704.asp?p=0) and can be used for other purposes than sharing music).

So how does it compare to what we at [ZAPPATA](http://www.zappatanetworks.com) are doing. I have outlined how ZAPPATA [solves email problems](http://www.zappatanetworks.com/news/7) (not just Spam). And we don't do anything proprietary either: We use known and trusted protocols: SMTP, POP3, IMAP, DNS. 

And while we don't envision [10 Million users by 2007](http://software.silicon.com/security/0,39024655,39124448,00.htm), we have a couple of other nice things planned for the future. 

Stay tuned!
