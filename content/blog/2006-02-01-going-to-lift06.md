In true geek tradition ([reboot7][1], then [Tweakfest][2]) I'm heading of to [Lift06][3] today. Lift is organized by [Laurent Haug][4] whom I met at reboot. Kudos to him for taking on the task of organizing a conference that pulls together a really impressive set of speakers. I'm particularly looking forward to seeing those people:

* [Cory Doctorow][5] 
* Bruce Sterling (whom I first saw  at [Tweakfest in ZÃ¼rich][6])
* [Marc Besson][7] about Digital Identity
* [Regine Debatty][8] - we make money, not art
* [Stefan Mastrogiacomo][9] about Organizational Design
* [Xavier Comtesse][10] about the internet and the other peoples revolution
* [Chris Lawer][11] on co-creation of knowledge
* [Sigurd Rinde][12] who finally talks about  [Thingamy][13] 
* [Euan Semple][14] about Knowledge Management (yep - that word is still in use)
* [Hugh MacLeoad][17] - global Microbranding
* [Robert Scoble][18] - changing Microsoft, one blog posting at a time

Of couse I also look forward to meeting all of the people I met in Denmark: [Henriette Weber Andersen][16], [Geoff Jones][19], and all the others)
