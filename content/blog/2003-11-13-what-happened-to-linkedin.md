Raphael of [Zoe](https://zoe.nu) fame invited me to connect to his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) network.

"Great", I thought, "pushing 20 connections" and clicked on the supplied link - only to be thrown a 404

Hmm - going directly to LinkedIn brought me [this strange page](https://www.invisible.ch/archives/linkedin.html)
. Whois GoDaddy?
