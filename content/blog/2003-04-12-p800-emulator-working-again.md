There were two things that set back my P800 development last week: 




  * My Symbian emulator crashed right after startup - making debugging of my application just a bit problematic


  * Way too much work - three clients, three deadlines


While I can do something about the second point (work, work some more, and then work at night), there's nothing much I could do about the constant crashing. The helpful people on the [forums](http://www.my-symbian.com/forum/) weren't being helpful so my app is sitting on the backburner at the moment.

But yesterday an [update of the UIQ SDK](http://www.ericsson.com/mobilityworld/sub/open/technologies/epoc/tools/7_uiq) was posted on the Sony-Ericsson site. After downloading the 12 MB and installing it, I tried to run the emulator (with little hope of it actually working) - but lo and behold: It started up and my app showed up. Time to spend a bit more time in the [Java IDEA](http://www.intellij.com) of choice and polish, then release it.
