The last weeks must have been a frenzy for [Dean](http://textism.com) and Jason over at [TextDrive](http://www.textdrive.com).

They managed to get 200 people to sign up for a [hosting](http://www.textdrive.com) package that enabled them to start a company. I have bought into it, and have so far received tremendous good support from Jason and Dean. Even special DNS configurations whishes were executed in "near-real-time". Sending an email to Jason (who does the sys admin thing) resulted in modified DNS record in less than 10 minutes. Impressive!

I have moved my first domain over to TextDrive and will move more (including this one) in the future. This relieves me a lot from worrying about the flaky ADSL connections I have had lately.

**Blatant Advertising follows**  

So, if you are looking for a great [web hosting](http://textdrive.com) provider, give them a serious look... The [specs](http://www.textdrive.com/specs/) of their server alone are worth a look.
