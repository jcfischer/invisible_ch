I've been busy working on an Atom parser the last couple of days. Time to also publish [ this blog in ATOM 0.3 format.](https://www.invisible.ch/atom.xml).

Thanks to [Mark](https://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/12/13/atom03) for the MT Plugin.

And now back to work. After the joys of Atom, now is the time for the dreariness of [RSS 2.0](https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss) and it's ugly parents.
