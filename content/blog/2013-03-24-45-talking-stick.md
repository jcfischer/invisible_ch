My friend and colleague [Alvaro](http://twitter.com/afussen) (who is responsible for the wonderful [Mobino iOS and Android apps](http://mobino.com/app)) has been working on an application of his own.

[Talking Stick](http://softbork.com/thetalkingstick/) launched today. It is a really simple app - that simulates a talking stick - the token that gives one power to speak. The app allows you to select number of participants, a mode for a discussion (several talk modes available) and then tracks the speaking time of everybody (and it also records what was said)

I have already suggested that we'd use this app to keep track on our internal discussions, unfortunately the suggestion was met with very little enthusiasm here at home. Maybe you fill fare better?

In any case, give it a try...
