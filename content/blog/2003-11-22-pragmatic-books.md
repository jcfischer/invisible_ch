I have enjoyed the [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X/invisiblech-20) and the [Programming Ruby: A Pragmatic Programmer's Guide](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201710897/invisiblech-20) books by [Dave](http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave) and [Andy](http://www.toolshed.com/blog)

Now they have written two new pragmatic books with a third on the way: [The Pragmatic Starter Kit](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/index.html) with books on CVS and JUnit already available. I'll be buying them after I finish this entry... (PDF or printed version? hmm - PDF is faster satisfaction)

(oh, and here are the Amazon.de links for the "real" books):

  * [The Pragmatic Programmer: From...](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X/invisiblech-21)
  * [Programming Ruby](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201710897/invisiblech-21)
