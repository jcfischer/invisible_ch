When everything is gloom, when your mood is dark, when work seems to much like work and to little like fun. When the sky is gray (or at least when it seems so), there is only one Cure.

You have to listen to Happy Music. I continued to rip my CD collection and got to rip all the [BÃ©la Fleck](https://www.flecktones.com/) CD's I own. They went on the iPod and I cheered up to pieces like _UFO TOFU_ or my favorite one _Sinister Minister_ which comes with a gorgeous bass solo by [Victor Wooten](https://www.victorwooten.com/) on  the _Live Art_ [[US](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002N7R/invisiblech-20) | [DE](https://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002N7R/invisiblech-21)   ] CD.

Highly recommended (And don't be put off, by the labels "country" or "blue grass" that sometimes are slapped on BÃ©la's music.
