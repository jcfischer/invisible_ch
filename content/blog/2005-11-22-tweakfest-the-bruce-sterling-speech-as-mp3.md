Both Bruce Sterling as well as the organizers of Tweakfest have allowed me to publish a recording of the speech that Bruce Sterling gave at this years Tweakfest. 



It was recorded using my Powerbook and it's built in microphone, so sound quality is, let's say "challenged". Still, Bruce can be understood without problems.



Enjoy: [Bruce Sterling at Tweakfest 05](/files/Tweakfest-BruceSterling.mp3) (24 MB, mp3, length 57:10)
