Walter Hehl, IBM Research Center Ruschlikon



Gives a broad overview on the progression of computer processing power and storage and how this influences "pervasive" computing. 



**Interesting points:**



_"What was once private is now public", "what was once hard to copy, is now trivial to duplicate" and "what was once easily forgotten, is now stored forever."_ (Ron Rivest)



IBM sees the nexus of "intelligence" in a household in the various incarnations of PlayStations, X-Boxes. Supposedly they started 5-6 years ago to design the (cell)processors that power or will power these devices.
