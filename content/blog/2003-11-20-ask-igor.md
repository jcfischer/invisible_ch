We had a good laugh at this one - people who know me personally and know what I did in the beginning of the year will know why...

[AskIgor](http://www.st.cs.uni-sb.de/askigor/) is a service that will automatically test faulty programs and tell you why they fail. (Limited to C/C++ Linux86 programs at the moment - but hey - some would argue that exactly these programs would benefit the most)

Interesting also is the work, that the people behind the AskIgor service are doing for [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org). They are developing a number of [plugins](http://www.st.cs.uni-sb.de/eclipse/) that analyze why your Java programs are failing. The first one, that is available already can deduce faulty input. 

Interesting reads on the site too.
