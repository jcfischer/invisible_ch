And boy does this seem to be difficult... Here's what I need:


  * b/w printing (color nice, but not fundamental)
  * duplex printing a big plus
  * Color scanner (good, but not pro quality)
  * Fax - manual and from computer
  * Network enabled (wireless plus)
  * Postscript plus


I don't care about ink / laser. Price is secondary, I want a high-quality experience. This for an office with 2-3 people and small-medium volume. No high-end machines please.

Are there any devices out there that do what I need to do? So far, the only one that seems remotely close is the HP OfficeJet 7140xi, but I have read mixed reviews...

Do you have experience? Let me know!
