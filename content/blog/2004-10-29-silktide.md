A very helpful site [Silktide Silkscore](https://sitescore.silktide.com/). It evaluates your website and gives suggestions on how to improve it. There's a marketing ploy there (Silktide offers consulting services) but I think this is brilliant and how the web is supposed to work - IMO. 

Silktide gives something valuable for free. They offer additional services - that's fine and the service they offer adds to their credibility. A win-win for all involved.
