It's time to show the music industry who their customers are -- by [boycotting](https://www.ccc.de/campaigns/boycott-musicindustry) them. (like [vowe](https://vowe.net/archives/004327.html))

After [Germany](https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/46115) the [swiss IFPI](https://www.ifpi-schweiz.ch/main.html) has [announced that they are sueing](https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/46160) "music pirates".

Well, dear music industry: You are alienating your [customers](https://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/special/copy/17076/1.html). I have bought > 800 CDs, a couple of 100 LPs (back in the old days) and a handfull of singles.

Music is part of my life (both listening and making) and I fully understand the need for artists to make a living. However, YOU, the music industry, are not helping. I would gladly buy music over the internet (ITunes music store), but you haven't been able to make that available to me.

I have ripped most of my music because I have a file server at home that stores my music and an IPod on the go. When I buy a CD, I rip it directly and then store it. A copy protected CD? Either I am able to copy it anyway, or I use EMule to get me a ripped version.

I will continue to listen to new music, using the internet. I will continue to support artists "that get it" (like the ones on [that are not evil](https://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7220) ([MagnaTune](https://www.magnatune.com/)). But I will not buy any more CD's that are brought out by "the music industry". 

And I will convince my friends to do the same.
