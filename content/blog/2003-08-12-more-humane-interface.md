uh-oh... [Hugh](http://www.cabezal.com/blog) [noticed](http://www.cabezal.com/blog/archives/000618.shtml#000618)...
Also, Guido van Rossum [reviews](http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&thread=4790) [The Humane Interface](/archives/000155.html)

Meanwhile, I have been busy sketching UI ideas for use in the browser (and that means, that I have to revisit [my opinon on browsers not being able to handle all UI needs](/archives/000132.html). I'm piecing together some DHTML / JavaScript technology to handle some of the new ideas I'm going to try out.

On another note: <iframes> don't seem to be such a bad idea after all...

I hope to have something to show you by the end of the week
