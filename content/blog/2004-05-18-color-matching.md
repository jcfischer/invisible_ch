Generate matching colors:


  * [Colormatch 5k](https://www.colormatch.dk/) (doesn't work well in Opera)
  * [ColorMatch Remix](https://color.twysted.net/) (works fine both in Mozilla and Opera)


Inspired my current experiments in designing a website with orange as a dominant color and [David Sheas entry on Colour Schemes](https://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/05/14/colour_schem/index.php)
