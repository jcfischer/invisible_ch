What a joy... coding a simple website with some text on the lower right, independent of browser window size. No, no JavaScript please. And no - no tables, they are so 90s. So - because it's "Ã  la mode" it's XHTML and CSS.

And because it's commercial, it should look good on a number of different systems. Also on a Mac. With IE on a Mac.

A couple of hours later - I give up. IE/Mac is so [broken](https://developer.apple.com/internet/css/ie5cssbugs.html), that there are [websites](https://www.quirksmode.org/) that deal with a lot of annoyances.

I have decided that I will not bother with IE / Mac. The Mac people have Safari after all... (And us non Mac users can use [iCapture](https://www.danvine.com/icapture/) to see how it would look like.)

The website is about [Personal Groupware](https://www.zappata.net/)? Ohh - and still in it's early infancy...

**Update:**
I have given up on the CSS version and returned to the table based version (which incidentally doesn't render to well on Opera - the browser I use). Things were looking good PC wise, but breaking up on the Macs we have. 4 hours spent to get a text in the lower right corner "the right, pure way with CSS". Do any of you out there now how to do it?

And on another related note - all your base are belong to us:
