This is quite an up / down week, with all kinds of -- let's call them -- interesting things happening.

On the negative side:
 
* The air is so dry, that I wake up every night with a mouth so dry that my tongue feels like rasping through death valley
* At the same time my nose is regularly clogged too, so the open mouth is a necessity to survive the night
* My laptop died while trying to go from standby to hibernat mode. It managed to screw up it's registry and boots immediately to a blue screen. Luckily the also installed [Ubuntu Linux][1] booted fine, and I was able to copy all of my files to an external firewire harddisk. (Note to self: Try to figure out why Ubuntu treats the harddisk of the Dell Inspiron as a VERY slow hard disk. The ususal hdparm tunings (-c1 -d1 ...) didn't increase the speed above 3 MB / s, which is just almost unbearable slow)
* My Linux server had a fit yesterday and crawled along with a load of 9000. A mercyful turning of the BRS brought it back to life.
 

On the positive side

* I don't have a laptop at the moment, so I'm continuing to [read the "Baroque Cycle"][2] -- at the moment 100 pages or so into "The system of the world"
* Several new projects are materializing in the not so distant future
* We'll be able to pick up our [Prius][3] after [a short time waiting][4] this friday
* In related "picking up new things", the [MacMini][5] has shipped and I expect it on friday too
* We're going to the theater tonight to see [Homo Faber][6]
* Friday night without kids (but a new car)
