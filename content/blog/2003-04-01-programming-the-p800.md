I've been playing around programming my P800. (BTW: This is by far the best mobile phone I've ever used - and it's PDA capabilities are impressive.) There are a couple of things missing - that's why I'm looking at the programming side.

I have coded with Java and my first application is coming along nicely. Stay tuned for more info.

In the meantime, here are some links to get you started:
