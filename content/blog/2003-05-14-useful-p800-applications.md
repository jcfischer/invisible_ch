Here are applications for the P800 that I really like:





  * [ActiveDesk](http://www.cibenix.com/ADP800_index.html): When you flip open the phone, a summary of your calendar entries, tasks and messages appears. I like it better than [Handy Day](http://se-p800-software.epocware.com/Handy_Day.html), YMMV


  * [Tipic](http://www.tipic.com) is a [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org) chat client that supports AIM, ICQ and Yahoo Messenger. Cool!


  * [SymIRC](http://sulaco.mureakuha.com/symirc/) is an IRC client



Both are written in PJava and perform really nice. A fully connected phone, good GPRS coverage and connectivity applications are a great thing. I'm reconsidering my sceptisim on "mobile connectivity".
