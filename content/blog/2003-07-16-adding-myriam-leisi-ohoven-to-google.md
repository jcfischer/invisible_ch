Yesterday while going out with friends we talked about what Google knows about us. Myriam said that she had googled for her Matthias before going out with him in earnest. We then wondered what Google might now about Myriam....
I checked - it knows nothing at all.
Time to change that...
Ohh - you wanted more information on Myriam? Where she lives? The pictures from her marriage? Private details? 
Ahh - but you have to know her better to get to know these things...
_Update:_Try [this search](http://www.google.com/search?q=myriam+leisi) to see how fast Google can be: Less than 24 between entering it and Google being aware of Myriam...
