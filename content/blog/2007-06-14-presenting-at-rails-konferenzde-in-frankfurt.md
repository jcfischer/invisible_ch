Next week, [rails-konferenz.de][1] is taking place in Frankfurt, Germany on Friday, 22nd of June. I will be there and present on "Working offline" using [Joyent Slingshot][2]. 

It's going to be my second appearance at Rails-Konferenz, and I'm very much looking forward to being there. Be sure to say Hi, if you are there too.
