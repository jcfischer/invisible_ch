According to [this meme](http://www.longstoryshortpier.com/vaults/2004/04/08/memery) about grabbing the nearest book and looking up the 5th sentence on page 23.

(the book is [The Humane Interface](http://blog.invisible.ch/archives/000155.html) by [Jef Raskin](http://humane.sourceforge.net/home/index.html))
