Almost no programming today, but meeting with people, discussing the future. Also looking into the cost of doing business and re-calculating our hourly rates (We need to stop subsidizing too many projects....)

In the end, we have decided to hire two new developers. If you are looking for a job in a great little company and are either a Software developer or a Web developer (or the combination of the two) then head over to our [Job Page](http://invisible.ch/ueber-uns/stellen) and take a look at our offering. Be sure to forward to other people that you might know.

And now off for the weekend - the start is tonights Amy MacDonald concert in Zurich, and then a long weekend of object oriented design ahead.
