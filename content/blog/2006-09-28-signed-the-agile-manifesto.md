As of today:

> [The Manifesto for Agile Software Development][1]



> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

> * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools 

> * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation 

> * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation 

> * **Responding to change** over following a plan
