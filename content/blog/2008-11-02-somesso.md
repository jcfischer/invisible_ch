On Halloween Friday was the [Somesso](http://www.somesso.com) conference on social media in RÃ¼schlikon. After last weeks Web 2.0 Expo in Berlin, this was a fresh and new conference put on by Arjen Strijker.

There were quite a few [bloggers](http://www.website-marketing.ch/978-somesso-wars-das-geld-wert-social-media-konferenz-in-zurich/) [covering](http://climbtothestars.org/) the confernce, the usual [slew of pictures](http://flickr.com/search/?q=somesso&m=tags) taken and of course a lot of chatter on [twitter](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=somesso).

I was invited by Arjen to do a short pitch on [Headshift](http://headshift.com). As others have noticed:



<blockquote>Es waren einige Agenturen darunter und einige davon waren bereits Ã¼ber 5 Jahre alt. Ob man sich dann noch als Startup bezeichnen darfn?</blockquote>

[phogenkamp](http://twitter.com/phogenkamp/status/983490521), [Blogging Tom](http://bloggingtom.ch/archives/2008/11/01/erfolgreiche-erste-somesso/) and 



<blockquote>when did Headshift become a startup? I love you guys, but youâ€™ve been around too long to be called that, imho.</blockquote>

([Stephanie](http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2008/10/31/somesso-startups/))

You guys are of course absolutely right, and I take the blame for that: The thing I promptly forgot to mention in my micro-presentation (I blame nervousness), is that we just have started the Headshift Switzerland project. While Headshift itself is about 5 years old, Headshift Switzerland just started as the result of a discussion between Lee and myself at this years [Lift08](http://liftconference.com) in Geneva. After several long discussions with [Lee](http://twitter.com/leebryant) and [Livio](http://twitter.com/livioh) we reached agreement on how this could work out.  So: Headshift Switzerland is the startup, Headshift the mothership. Sorry for giving a false impression. As for 'not a technology startup... Well, there were some interesting boxes in the Lab at Headshift Towers. Just not quite ready to be talked about :)

The other bloggers have done a good job at recapping the conference, Arijen did a great job with the conference itself, and I met a lot of really interesting people and took some new ideas - one will hopefully materialise in a blog post soon.
