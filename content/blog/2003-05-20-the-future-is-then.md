Ever wanted to make a prediction about the future? To bet on it? Head over to [Longbets.org](https://www.longbets.org/) to do so. 

One of the bets:


<blockquote>The first discovery of extraterrestrial life will be someplace other than on a planet or on a satellite of a planet</blockquote>


Betters include "ordinary" people like Freeman Dyson, Esther Dyson, Dave Winer, Ray Kurzweil, Mitch Kapor, Danny Willis, Nathan Myhrvold and many more
