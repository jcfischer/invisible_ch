Only a few more days, and the Rails World will converge on Berlin for [RailsWayCon][1], an alternative conference to the cancelled RailsConf Europe. 

I will be teaching a workshop on BDD on monday, 25.5 - including working with [Cucumber][2].

See the complete [Schedule][3]. I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of good presentations and meeting old and new friends. The lineup of speakers is impressive: Ola Bini, Steven Bristol, Neal Ford, Michael (Koz) Koziarski, Yehuda Katz, Jan Krutisch, Mathias Meyer,  Maik Schmidt, Stefan Tilkov,  Jonathan Weiss, Heiko Webers and others.

There still are tickets available, be sure to check out the discounts for students and freelancers over at the [registration page][4]
