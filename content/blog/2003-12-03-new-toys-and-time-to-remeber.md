I moved my Linux Home Server from a [Sereniti 2000](http://www.techcase.de/product_info.php?products_id=341) case (which is a hopeless piece of crap, cheap metal, had to hammer one screw through the aluminium because it was stuck and the screwdriver literally screwed it, and noisy as hell) with a smaller [Morex 2688](http://www.mini-itx.de/Morex/cubid2688v20.htm) which sports a lot less space inside but has no fans! Ahh - a quiet server - unless it's accessing the harddisk...
This will go in a closet soon and serve my music and my videos and backup my Windows PC's here at Chaos Central.

Next on the toylist was a [Neuston Virtuoso MC-500](http://www.neuston.com/en/mc500.asp) - an audio and video streaming box. It can play MP3, OGG, MPG-2, MPG-4 and probably more. It sports DVI, SCART (RGB Component), Optical and Coax Digital outputs, 100 MBIt Ethernet and a PC Card slot for a WLAN PC-Card. Nice stuff. And it works! Truly plug and play. 
Downsides so far? Sure: Requires a Windows PC as a streaming server (even though the software seems to be written in Java). It doesn't play all DivX profiles (and no QuickTime or RealMedia)

The upside? It cost me about US$200 - which I consider an attractive price. 

Right now it sit's next to the living room TV and plays [Does Humour Belong in Music](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000009TE/invisiblech-21) (Amazon.de) by [Frank Zappa](http://www.zappa.com). He [died exactly 10 years ago](http://www.hotshotdigital.com/WellAlwaysRemember.3/FrankZappa.html).

Frank we miss you!
_Politics is the entertainment branch of industry._ [F.Z.] from the [Zappa QOTD](http://www.invisible.ch/archives/000082.html).

Oh - there's also the [Does Humor Belong in Music DVD](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000E2W05/invisiblech-20) (amazon.com)
