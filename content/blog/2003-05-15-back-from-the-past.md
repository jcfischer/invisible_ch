[Vowe](http://vowe.net/archives/003311.html) discusses the value of "[WikiWiki](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWiki) in Domino. (Because people are starting to do that). Well - I've done it a couple of years ago - and I've had mixed joy from it. The lack of a regular expression parser in Notes has led to some quite ugly parsing code and not all of the Wiki features are available. Still - as a "gift" to the community: Here's my [NotesWiki](http://www.invisible.ch/files/NotesWiki.nsf) for your pleasure. Do with this code whatever you like, feel free to laugh at me - whatever.

If you manage to fix it, improve it or use it successfully, let me know.
