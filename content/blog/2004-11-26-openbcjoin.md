After [vowe](http://vowe.net) has done it, here's my [invitation to join openBC](http://www.openbc.com/go/invuid/JensChristian_Fischer).

OpenBC seems a lot more complete than [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) and it has a distinct european touch. And that sounds kind of sensible when you do business mostly (ok - exclusively) in europe.

Join in!
