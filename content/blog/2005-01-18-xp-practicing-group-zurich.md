No, we're not talking Windows XP, but [eXtreme Programming][1]. (Small but important difference)
Jim Weirich is doing an interesting thing in the [Cincinnati XP Users Group][2]. They meet once a month to not only talk about XP, but to actually practice it. Doing this, they write software for a children hospital and learn XP (and they probably have fun too)

As a practicioner of [ExtremeHacking][3] (that is working alone, using some of the XP methods) I'd be extremely interested in starting something like this in Switzerland (and maybe even in Zurich). There is a [XpAdoptersGroupSwitzerland][4] and I have posted the same on the mailing list, but I'll repeat it here:

I'm willing to organise an event (maybe one evening every month) where everybody brings their laptop and we'll do some small project, XP style. I guess there are enough interesting small things that could be done in a couple of sessions and the idea is that everybody benefits, learns something new, practises XP and in general has fun.

Programming languages of choice? I'd say Ruby and/or Java. Who's in?
