invisible is not only the name of this blog, but also the name of my company "invisible Jens Christian Fischer". I do consulting, Lotus Notes / Domino mainly, intranets, web development and so on. (If you need a consultant in this area, send me an email)

My wife's company is called "visible". 

Both are what is called "Einzelfirmen" - they are companies that belong to individuals and as such, the company is me, and I'm the company. 

Well - it makes sense for our companies to merge. We announce the forming of the new company "InVisible GmbH" as of today.

Unfortunately that means that the blog has to move to a new location, as you may have noticed, the new URL is [blog.invisible.ch](http://blog.invisible.ch/).
