Feed reading on my [tiny tiny RSS instance](/2013/03/21/48-tiny-tiny-rss-on-synology/) is quite nice. I had to change a few CSS properties (make the font bigger for my old eyes) and I installed another (more [Google Reader like CSS](http://www.bergercity.de/allgemein/google-reader-style-fur-tiny-tiny-rss/comment-page-1/)). I have started to look at the options, learnt how to enable the digest plugin (edit config.php to enable it) and actually read through the descriptions of the different features on the [TT-RSS home page](http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki).

Today I also got a mail from [TheOldReader](http://theoldreader.com/)Â that my feeds had been imported - just around a week after I uploaded the OPML file to them. I think I'll pass :)

The only thin I really miss (already) is the Reeder app on my iPad - that's where I usually read my RSS.
