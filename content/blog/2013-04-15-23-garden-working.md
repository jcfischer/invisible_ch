Finally the "garden working" days have started. As the end of the development and deployment of a major feature of the Mobino backend (alas, totally invisible to the users, but simplifying a lot internally), the tech team spent the afternoon in our garden, fixing a few problems (suddenly, the database changed the way it returned data, leading to much joy because suddenly something that in fact was buggy (but worked) turned out to be just buggy) and enjoying the sun and warmth of a wonderful spring day. We are still debating the absolute gain in productivity of garden vs. office work, but in terms of enjoyment, I think garden wins hands down.

In the evening, a wonderful meal courtesy of my wife, with almost the complete team - including our CEO who came in from the Welschland.

Eating, talking, drinking, some singing and playing made for a great start into the new week.
