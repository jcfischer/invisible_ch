Why hasn't anybody shown me this before? [Modify fields from a view level without creating an agent](http://www.madjunk.com/AVS0003/madjunk.nsf/topic/E5074ED53A148A9586256C47000F35EA?OpenDocument)

This little formula allows you to edit any field with any type in a notes document. This is so handy when developing....
