I travelled to Munich today for a very important meeting about [my company](http://www.ivorix.com). Due to the strike of the strike of the railroad workers in Austria, I traversed a tiny part of Austria by bus, curtesy of swiss railroads. Unfortunately that prolonged the trip by 45 minutes. In the afternoon preparations for the meeting that took place at 6. A quick coffee with an old friend in a Biergarten, and then almost 4 hours of meetings with shareholders and investors. 

A glass of wine, bread and cheese, and a quick check on the email and the blog. There was another comment spammer that got through the [new defenses](http://www.invisible.ch/archives/000196.html) - how are they doing it? By hand?

The meeting went much better than anticipated. There was a lot of tension before the meeting, nerves raw - but in the end we all were on the same page, in the same book again. Plans were made, tasks defined.

I'm totally exhausted - physically and mentally. And tomorrow I have to get up at 6:30, catch a train at 8:12, hope for the end of the strike in Austria and be with two clients in the afternoon, before I can relax into the weekend.

And the most important thing today? I got to hold David Elia, the 15 day old son of my best friend Ben. Mazel Tov!
