It took a bit longer than we wanted too, but I'm happy to announce that the PDF version of my Rails Book is now available.

The book is getting excellent reviews (which I am very grateful for) and has been selling quite well on Amazon, thank you all

You can buy the PDF version directly from the publisher: [Professionelle Webentwicklung mit Ruby on Rails 2 (PDF)](http://www.mitp.de/vmi/mitp/detail/pWert/516831/titel/Professionelle%20Webentwicklung%20mit%20Ruby%20on%20Rails%202%20E-BOOK). The price is 28 Euro, a discount of 20%

If you prefer the dead-tree version, you can get it either from the [publisher](http://www.mitp.de/vmi/mitp/detail/pWert/1683/titel/Ruby%20on%20Rails%202.0%20in%20der%20Praxis) or from Amazon. Unfortunately, we aren't able to offer you a combo of both products because of german 'Buchpreisbindung'.

If you want to browse the book online, head over to [rails-praxis.de](http://rails-praxis.de) where a few sample chapters are available as PDF and the whole book as HTML (really really soon now).
