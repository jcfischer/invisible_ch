![](files/flow-tn.png)talking virtually 



While most of the added value of a conference is coming from the face to face meetings with a bunch of different people, the tech-crowd can do amazing things when given WiFi and some tools. 

I witnessed this power the first time at reboot 7.0 when spontaneous collaboration emerged.

I'd like to give something to the reboot crowd - an experiment in chatting. [chat.invisible.ch][1] is a chat system without rooms, but with tags - where discussions can focus and defocus - not in rooms, but in connected ideas.
