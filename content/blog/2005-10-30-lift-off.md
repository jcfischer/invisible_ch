Laurent Haug of [ballpark.ch](https://www.ballpark.ch/blog/) is organizing a conference called [Lift06](https://www.lift06.org/) in Genva in the beginning of February. 



The [roster of speakers](https://www.lift06.org/doku.php/people:speakers) looks promising, the price (CHF 295) looks right and Geneva is only a train ride away.



I think I'll be there ([Laurent still needs a Ruby on Rails demo](https://www.ballpark.ch/blog/english/32/european-internet-project))
