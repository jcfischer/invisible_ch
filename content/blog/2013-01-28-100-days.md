Readers of this blog (there might be a few left) might have noted, that I haven't blogged much the last months / years. I spend most of my online time on Twitter ( [@jcfischer](http://twitter.com/jcfischer)Â ) and the rest of the time I tend to work - [Mobino](http://mobino.com) is the company I have co-founded with [J.F. Groff](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=3069363&locale=en_US&trk=tyah). and I'm acting and working as CTO. We are building a (nay, the) mobile payment system for 5 billion people, and I can tell you, it's a ride.

I have had quite a bit happening in 2012, and 2013 looks like an equally interesting year. I sometimes miss writing / thinking out loud, and the blog (in its state of despair) has always nagged me. Today on Twitter I saw 140 characters about a "blog every day for 100 days" movement (of course I can't remember who tweeted it, and my Google-Fu has left me) so I can't give credit, or link to the article / manifesto / site in question...

Nonetheless, this is what I plan to do: Blog every day for the next 100 days. [Lift.do](http://lift.do/) will help me (maybe) - feel free to [track my progress](http://lift.do/users/d2dc6d9f8d042a30c455).

Onwards (only 99 blog posts to go)
