## Invisible

I have been on the internet for a long time, and had various online presences.
This is the 2019 one (created in the years between 2018 and 2019). I have blogged
for over a decade but stopped a couple of years ago and left my old blog rot and 
disintegrate. I have been active on some of the social media plattforms, but am not
happy with their walled garden approach to content. 

I am a developer, musician, cloud & infrastructure operator, artist, maker. I live
in Zurich, Switzerland and have way too many interests.
