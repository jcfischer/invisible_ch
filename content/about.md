## What am I doing now?

see my [now](/now) page

## Invisible?

Many years ago, my wife and I each started our own companies. Hers was called *visible*, mine was called *invisible*.
After some years we merged and formed *InVisible GmbH*. I used the domain [invisible.ch](https://invisible.ch) both
for personal and business. Right now, it is personal again.
