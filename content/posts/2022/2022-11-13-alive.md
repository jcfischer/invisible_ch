After over two^h^h^h three years of not doing anything here, the recent exodus from "Birdsite" to Mastodon
has brought up the topic of self hosted and independent content. Time to dust of the old blog.

I had to update a few files in my [Chaschper Theme](https://github.com/jcfischer/hugo-chaschper) to make it compatible 
with a more recent version of Hugo than the one I had installed. I also had to do the usual Yak shaving to get 
everything back up to speed on a new laptop (where new is relative - I've had this machine for over 6 months and
just not had the need to run Git or Hugo from the commandline since then. New job, new profile - long story, and one 
for another day)

So what are the next plans:

- Link this site to my Mastodon profile: [@jcfischer@social.invisible.ch](https://social.invisible.ch/@jcfischer)
- Upload a bunch of music I have created in the last two years
- maybe get back to regular blogging?
- update the [Now](/now) page - it's woefully out of date
