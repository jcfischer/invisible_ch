After a hiatus of many, many years in the blogosphere; after a growing dissatisfaction
with the way social media (I'm looking at you, Facebook) is building walled gardens; 
after the perceived need of having a place for a portfolio of my works, I have decided to
resurrect my blog with some [new technology](/articles/choosing-platform) and start all 
fresh. 

I have also decided to leave the old content buried in a broken database and in an exported
XML file. Most of it is no longer technically relevant, and those personal pieces from the 
past, they are - well - from the past. May they rest in pieces and 404s.
