title: "Choosing a Platform for this new site"
---

I wanted to bring back from the dead my old website, which was running on an old version
of WordPress. It probably got hacked, as one day I received a text from a friend, asking about
the error message that showed up (instead of the stale content that hadn't been updated for 
years)

I also wanted to move away from WordPress and was looking for alternatives. Via a blog post 
I read (yes, blogs still are a thing, it seems) I found [Ghost](https://ghost.org) which looked 
good. Instead of just diving straight into installing it, I decided to [ask the collective wisdom
of Twitter for suggestions](https://twitter.com/jcfischer/status/1078567149986295808).


| Name | Votes |
|------|-------|
| [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) |  6 |  
| [Ghost](https://ghost.org) | 2 |
| [Eleven_ty](https://11ty.io) | 1 | 
| [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) | 1 |
| [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) | 1 |
| [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) | 1 |
| [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) | 1 |  
| [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) | 1 | 
| [Perun](https://perun.io) | 1 | 

After a long amount of deliberation, I decided to try Hugo. Installation and setup was a breeze, 
writing in Markdown and storing things in Git are things I like. Originally I wanted to self host
the resulting site, but after seening a lot of my colleagues recommending [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
I decided to try that as well. Again, the setup was a breeze, including setting up and moving DNS to them. 

The biggest time sink was selecting a template from [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io) - I spent
several hours downloading and trying templates. In the end I selected
[Casper-Two](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-casper-two/) a port of Ghost template. I will probably have
to make some changes to it, but for the moment it does what it needs to do.
