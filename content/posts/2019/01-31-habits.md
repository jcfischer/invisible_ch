Almost exactly 6 years after I talked about [Habits](/2013/01/29/99-habits/) it is time
to pick up the topic again. It seems that starting a new year brings out the desire to 
work on self-improvement in me. And that means working on all of the things that
"one should do" regularly (like brushing teeth).

A couple of years ago, I tried the [BJ Fogg Tinyhabits](https://www.tinyhabits.com/) method
to intrduce new habits (it seems that the topic of [Micro Habits](https://www.startpage.com/do/dsearch?query=micro+habits&cat=web&pl=ext-ff&language=english)
is the new hot shit anyway) and failed spectacularly. I don't even remeber what I tried
to achieve then. Other habits have been more successful: 2 years ago I bought an Apple 
Watch and have been closing my rings almost every day ever since (I'm on day 703 of 1000). 
I learned that I needed to be able to make exceptions (being sick is one of them, helping
kids prepare for final exams another) and be ok to breaking the chain. Still I have been 
walking to work almost every single day for the past two years. 

This beginning of January I decided to have a go at making more habits again, also because
I was prompted by the [Unlock Your Performance](https://playinthezone.com/unlock-your-performance/) course
I did. Mark introduced the small daily habits that help you work on getting a better performer.

So I downloaded [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com/), an iOS app that keeps track of up to 12 habits 
and decided to start the following 5-6 habits (new or old ones):

- 30 "Me Minutes" each morning, consisting of 10-15 minutes of Yoga and 10 minutes
  meditiation
- Weigh myself
- Measure blood-pressure (and take the pills to lower it)
- Fast for 16 hours every day (no food after dinner until lunch the next day)
- Practice guitar for 20 minutes

So how did it go?

{{< figure src="/images/2019-01-31-streaks.PNG" caption="Overview over length of streaks for the habits" >}}

- 31 days of "Me Minutes": Check
- 30 days of recording my weight (I started a day later): Check
- 31 days of measuring the blood pressure: Check
- 29 days of intermittent fasting (started 2 days later): Check
- 12 days of guitar practice: Fail

In addition to that, I have been going to the gym 1-2 times per week as well for the last 4 weeks,
but I'm not tracking that. 

I'm quite happy with how I managed to hold up - but as [vowe says](https://vowe.net/archives/017677.html)
it takes 60 days before habits really are ingrained. I will keep you updated, dear reader. 

As for the failing habit: I haven't had the energy to sit down after work and pick up the guitar and 
do serious practice. I'm missing making music, but I'm learning to accept the fact that I don't have
the endless amount of energy I had in earlier years. I probably should practice in the morning, but that
clashes with the other routines. 

Finally, as if on queueu, [Derek Sivers wrote about Daily Journaling](https://sivers.org/dj) today. 
I will add that as a 6th habit for the coming month and see how that works out.
