Having a git based blog makes it slightly 
difficult to post while on the go. 
I have read at least [two](#) [accounts](https://schnuddelhuddel.de/switching-from-wordpress-to-hugo/)  of people who pulled that off, but neither workflow quite worked for me.

Here's where I'm at:

* use [WorkingCopy](https://workingcopyapp.com) to clone this sites [jcfischer/invisible_ch](https://github.com/jcfischer/invisible_ch) repository 
* use a Siri shortcut to [convert urls to markdown links](Create Markdown Link.shortcut)

{{< figure src="/images/working-copy.png" title="working in Working Copy" >}}

Things I tried that didn't work: 

* using [Git2Go](https://git2go.com/) - app not available on Swiss AppStore
* using [Editorial for iOS](https://omz-software.com/editorial/) to edit posts. Looks nice, but crashes when trying to open a file from WorkingCopy (also not adapted to iPhone X screen)

Will update this post as I learn more.
