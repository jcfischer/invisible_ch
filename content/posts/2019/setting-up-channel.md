A recent addition to my home studio is the [Behringer XR18](http://www.musictribe.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Digital/XR18/p/P0BI8) digital stage box mixer. It has replaced an old Yamaha mixer. The main feature of it is that it has none of the wonderful faders and buttons. Instead, the mixer is controlled via apps, either from a computer or a tablet or phone.

While researching mixers I came across a video on [Setting up a Channel on a Behringer XR 18 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymx-udidEcw&feature=share). Even though it shows the Behringer interface, the general principles shown should transfer to any mixer. I learnt quite a lot about configuring a channel.
