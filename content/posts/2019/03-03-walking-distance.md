I was travelling home from Basel last Friday afternoon, when two 
gentleman sat down across me on the train. One of them mentioned, that he just had 
stowed his cymbals, and that he was in a band that was an on a small european tour.
We started talking and found out that we shared views not only on music but also
on a lot of other topics, more or less related to music.

The gentlemans name was Shawn Baltazor and he was touring with his 3 band mates
in a band called [Walking Distance](https://walkingdistanceband.com), and heading to
play first in [Kasheme](https://kasheme.com) and the next day at [Mehrspur](https://www.mehrspur.ch/veranstaltungen/walking-distance) as part of their NYC concerts. 

Luckily we didn't have any plans for Saturday night, so I had a chance to see the band
(supported by [Travis Reuter](http://travisreuter.com/) on guitar). They were playing songs
from their [Freebird](https://walkingdistanceband.bandcamp.com/album/freebird) album. On Freebird,
they worked with Charlie Parker songs and applied various principles to transform them and 
investigate new music that is generated by applying specific principles.

An example is the "alphatbetical sorting of note pitches". Based on the [Of Oz the Wizard](https://vimeo.com/150423718), 
a collage of the movie "The Wizard of Oz", that is sorted completely alphabetically (go and watch it, it
is funny and makes sense on some weird level), they re-arranged "Ornothology" by Charlie Parker
and came up with [Simple Ghilnooorty](https://song.link/i/1430270854). 

Shawn told me about that
process on the train, and I found it delightful on an intellectual level, but I couldn't quite imagine
how that would sound like as music. Turns out, it does, and it turned into a deeply hypnotizing piece of 
new music. It's fascinating, that each of the pieces the played is a complete transformation from the
original tune by Bird, but couldn't exist without the tune in the first place (and the ingenuity of 
the members of "Walking Distance").

It was an inspiring evening, with wonderful music from five great musicians and we ended up talking
for quite a while afterwards. I'm sure, our paths will cross again - there was a definitive sense
of Synchronicity to this random chance meeting.

If you are into modern Jazz, composed with a technical background but played with soul, go and check 
out their albums.
