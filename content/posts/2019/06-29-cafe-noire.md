One thing leads to another. Someone I know knows someone, we exchange emails and he sees that I make music and asks me to perform some live music at a private event. Thus was born "Cafe noire". It had been many months since I performed and I was nervous about how much I would be able to bring to the event. It turns out that I'm really happy how the performance went. I was able to create an ambient sound scape that conveys a mood and that I still enjoy when I listen back to it.

Enjoy your coffee, and watch out for Mr. Satie visiting.
