Two days ago, when I resurrected this blog, I thought I'd just start from scratch,
leaving the 930+ old blog posts forever gone. Then I read how Amit [moved from Squarespace to Hugo](https://www.amitgawande.com/page/setup/#migrating-the-content) using the [ExitWP](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp)
tool to convert a Wordpress XML export to markdown files. I had an old export file lieing around and
after just a few minutes with ExitWP I had 936 Markdown files, spanning 10 years (2003 &mdash; 2013) of
my old blog content. 

Many of the old links will be broken, no images or files made the transfer, but it's actually great to
see 10 years of my life re-appear.
