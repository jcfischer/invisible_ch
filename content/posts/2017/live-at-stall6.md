In 2017, I played multiple times at [Stall6](https://www.stall6.ch/) where 
[Richard Csizmazia](https://www.facebook.com/richardcsizmazia) organised the
[Signal Zirkus Zurich](https://www.meetup.com/Signal-Zirkus-Zurich/) meetups.

Most of the concerts weren't recorded (mostly due to failures of my equipment), 
but on 2017-07-18 the stars were aligned and I was able to record the whole set.
